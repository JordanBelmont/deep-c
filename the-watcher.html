                        Magazine</i>. The article details the 2014 story of the Broaddus family who, after purchasing
                     their new home at 657 Boulevard in Westfield, New Jersey, were stalked via letters by an unknown
                     entity referring to itself as 'The Watcher'.
                     <br /><br />
                     The incident led to the family never actually moving into the house and eventually selling the
                     house at a loss.
                     <br /><br />
                     The case has never been solved, and many speculate whether the entire situation was real or a hoax
                     devised by the Broaddus family.

                     Westfield, New Jersey. Prior to the Broaddus family moving in, there was no reported instance of
                     any strange happenings centered on the property.

                     the history of the house? Do you know what lies within the walls of 657 Boulevard? Why are you
                     here? I will find out.
                     <br /><br />
                     I see already that you have flooded 657 Boulevard with contractors so you can destroy the house
                     as
                     it was supposed to be. Tsk, tsk, tsk... bad move. You don't want to make 657 Boulevard unhappy.
                     <br /><br />
                     I asked the Wood's to bring me young blood and it looks like they listened.
                     <br /><br />
                     You have children. I have seen them. So far I think there are three that I have counted.
                     Do you need to fill the house with the young blood I requested? Better for me. Was your old
                     house
                     too small for the growing family? Or was it greed to bring me your children? Once I know their
                     names I will call to them and draw them too [sic] me.
                     <br /><br />
                     Who am I? There are hundreds and hundreds of cars that drive by 657 Boulevard each day. Maybe I
                     am
                     in one. Look at all the windows you can see from 657 Boulevard. Maybe I am in one. Look out any
                     of
                     the many windows in 657 Boulevard at all the people who stroll by each day. Maybe I am one.
                     <br /><br />
                     Welcome my friends, welcome. Let the party begin.

                     Derek immediately reported the letter to the Westfield Police Department, though they weren't
                     able
                     to help much beyond some simple suggestions and enquiring if Derek had any enemies.
                     <br /><br />
                     After joining his family at their old home, Derek and Maria wrote an email to the previous
                     owners,
                     John and Andrea Woods, asking if they knew anything of 'The Watcher'. The Woods' responded,
                     saying that they had also received a letter from 'The Watcher', mentioning that it was odd and
                     talked about The Watcher's family watching over the house, but she and her husband simply
                     discarded
                     it. The Woodses' accompanied Maria to the police station, where Detective Leonard Lugo told her
                     not
                     to mention the letters to anyone, especially her neighbours, who were now all suspects.

                     blood play in the basement? Or are they too afraid to go down there alone. I would [be] very
                     afraid

                     better part of two decades now. The Woods family turned it over to you. It was their time to

                     The 1960s were a good time for 657 Boulevard when I ran from room to room imagining the life
                     with
                     the rich occupants there. The house was full of life and young blood. Then it got old and so did
                     my
                     father. But he kept watching until the day he died. And now I watch and wait for the day when
                     the
                     young blood will be mine again.

                     657 Boulevard is turning on me. It is coming after me. I don't understand why. What spell did
                     you
                     cast on it? It used to be my friend and now it is my enemy. I am in charge of 657 Boulevard. It
                     is
                     not in charge of me. I will fend off its bad things and wait for it to become good again. It
                     will
                     not punish me. I will rise again.
                     <br /><br />
                     I will be patient and wait for this to pass and for you to bring
                     the young blood back to me. 657 Boulevard needs young blood. It needs you. Come back. Let the
                     young
                     blood play again like I once did. Let the young blood sleep in 657 Boulevard. Stop changing it
                     and
                     let it alone.

                     neighbors who has no idea who The Watcher could be. Or maybe you do
                     know and are too scared to tell anyone. Good move.
                     <br /><br />
                     I walked by the news trucks when they took over my neighborhood and mocked me.
                     <br /><br />
                     I watched as you watched from the dark house in an attempt to find me … Telescopes and
                     binoculars
                     are wonderful inventions.
                     <br /><br />
                     657 Boulevard survived your attempted assault and stood strong with its army of supporters
                     barricading its gates, my soldiers of the Boulevard followed my orders to a T. They carried out
                     their mission and saved the soul of 657 Boulevard with my orders.
                     <br /><br />
                     All hail The Watcher!!!

                     Maybe a car accident. Maybe a fire. Maybe something as simple as a mild illness that never seems
                     to
                     go away but makes you fell sick day after day after day after day after day. Maybe the
                     mysterious
                     death of a pet. Loved ones suddenly die. Planes and cars and bicycles crash. Bones break.

                     With only letters as evidence, investigators could only go on intuitions and scant hunches that
                     the letters revealed: A number of old-fashioned mannerisms in the letters led them to believe it
                     was an older writer; the literary style of the writing suggested an avid reader; and lack of
                     profanity suggested someone less masculine.

                  <p>
                     The Langfords were neighbours of the Broadduses, living just next door. A fellow neighbour,
                     John Schmidt filled Derek Broaddus in on the members of the family, including that of Michael
                     Langford who was described as odd, was unemployed, and suffered from schizophrenia. For a large
                     portion of the investigation, Derek was certain one of the Langfords was been behind The
                     Watcher letters.

                     The second letter from The Watcher mentioned one of the Broaddus children using an easel,
                     information which would have been hard to note due to the child using the easel on a porch
                     hidden
                     away from the street, but directly facing the Langford house.

                     Another implicating detail, is that The Watcher had mentioned that their father had begun
                     watching
                     657 Boulevard since the 1960s and the current Watcher for the better part of two decades.
                     Incidentally, Richard Langford, the patriarch of the family had passed away 12 years prior to
                     the
                     first letter being received. The Langfords were also one of the only families in the area to
                     have
                     been there since the '60s.

                     During his investigation into The Watcher, detective Barron Chambliss staked out 657 Boulevard
                     one
                     evening and noted a car parked suspiciously near the residence. On tracing the car, Chambliss
                     found
                     the car belonged to a woman whose boyfriend lived on the same block as 657 Boulevard. He
                     suspected
                     the girlfriend may have helped her boyfriend write the letters, hence female DNA on one of the
                     envelopes.
                     Upon questioning, the woman revealed that her boyfriend had a penchant for dark video games,
                     including one where he plays as a character named 'The Watcher'.
                     Though the boyfriend agreed to be interviewed, he failed to turn up twice, and Chambliss soon
                     moved
                     on.

                     Other theories swirled that The Watcher may have been someone who was outbid on the property by
                     the
                     Broadusses and, in jealousy, decided to exact revenge.

                     A large contingent of people, including their neighbours, believe the Broaddus family may have
                     been
                     responsible for The Watcher letters themselves.
                     <br /><br />
                     Several reasons were put forth by theorists: from buyer's remorse and insurance fraud to
                     scheming
                     for a movie deal or looking to defraud the Woods family, but all stemming from the idea that the
                     letters were all concocted and written by the Broadduses themselves.

                     Lending credence to this theory, many pointed out how the property value of 657 Boulevard
                     skyrocketed from $300,000 to $1.3 million, allowing them to refinance their mortgages in the
                     span
                     of 10 years.

                     Similarly, some questioned why they continued to renovate a house they never
                     intended to live in, while others found it too much of a coincidence that the letters only began
                     to
                     appear around the time the Broadduses purchased the house.

                     Despite this, a number of facts related to the case detract from the hoax theory. Firstly, the
                     family opted to inform potential buyers of The Watcher, when it was suggested that they
                     needn't do that.

                     </a>
                     The Watcher letters not only made it incredibly difficult for the Broadduses to
                     sell the house, the story also depreciated the value of the house, netting the family a loss of
                     around $400,000.

                     The family also declined earlier deals to sell their story, only selling to
                     Netflix with conditions, and only after attempting to mitigate their losses in other ways first.
