                  <p>
                     The murders of Hinterkaifeck saw the death of six victims at a Bavarian
                     farmstead in Waidhofen, Germany, on the night of 31 March 1922. It's believed that the assailant(s)
                     lived with the corpses of their victims for three days before moving on. During the 3-day period,
                     the food in the house had been consumed, animals on th property had been taken care of, and the
                     fireplace had been lit. The bodies of all six victims were later found on the property, having all
                     been killed with a mattock.
                     <br /><br />
                     Mysterious circumstances leading up to the murders have fuelled speculation on the perpetrator and
                     motive over the years, with theories ranging from the personal to the political. The case remains
                     unsolved, and is considered one of Germany's most harrowing and confounding crimes.

                        Partriarch of the Gruber family. His body was found alongside his wife Cäzilia's, daughter
                        Viktoria's and granddaughter Cäzilia's, stacked atop one another in the farmstead barn. The body

                        Upon autopsy, Andreas was found to have had the right side of his face smashed, with his cheek
                        bones showing and torn flesh. The cause of death has been attributed to bleeding out from a
                        wound found on his carotid artery, thought to have been caused by falling onto the tip of a
                        pickaxe that was later found in the animal feeding trough.

                        attributed to bleeding out, having had her throat slit using a pocket knife that was found

                     Hinterkaifeck was a self-sufficient, rural farmstead located roughly 43 miles north of Munich.
                     Nearby surroundings included dense woodland known as Kaifeck,

                     The farm was separated out into five main locations:

                           <br />
                           The house consisted of a large, communal kitchen; a bedroom for Andreas and Cäzilia Gruber; a
                           bedroom for Viktoria, Cäzilia and Josef Gabriel; and a bedchamber for the live-in maid. The
                           house also contained an upper attic space.

                           Connected to the house was the barn. The barn contained stables for the various livestock on
                           the farm; storage for hay and straw; and a narrow feeding aisle that connected the house
                           kitchen, through the stable, on into the deeper parts of the barn.

                           The machine room was a large area attached to the barn which housed a majority of the
                           machines used on the farm.

                           The engine house was a small, shed-like structure attached to the exterior of the barn. It

                     Due to the case taking place in 1922, as well as unreliable witness testimony, improper handling of
                     the investigation and loss of evidence, the exact timeline of events can only be pieced together
                     from a mosaic of often contradictory sources, rumours and speculation.
                     <br /><br />
                     The ominous events leading up to the Hinterkaifeck murders began sometime around August,
                     1921. The maid at the time, Kreszenz Rieger was the first to notice strange happenings taking
                     place at the farm. She experienced tapping sounds coming from within the walls of the farmstead
                     house; strangers speaking to her from her window at night; footsteps heard coming from the attic;
                     and her chamber door opening around the same time each night, despite it being locked.

                     After mentioning these incidents to Andreas, he reluctantly investigated the attic but found no
                     signs of anyone having been up there. A few weeks later, Rieger told the Gruber family
                     that she was resigning, warning the family that she felt she was being watched and that someone
                     sinister was hiding on the farm, or that it was haunted.

                     Over the next 6 months, the family failed to find a replacement maid. Andreas eventually admitted
                     during this time that he could also hear the strange tapping sounds and footsteps in the attic.

                     copy of the "Munchner Zeitung" newspaper from Munich being found on the property, one that
                     none of the family, nor any neighbours subscribed to.

                     Reluctantly, Viktoria eventually admitted to the pastor that she was the one who had left the
                     money, but never explained why.

                     all over the property. Upon further investigation, Andreas found the lock to the engine house had
                     been broken, while the lock to the tool shed had also been tampered with and showed signs of
                     heavy damage.

                     According to Sophie Fuchs, school-friend of Cäzilia Gabriel, a heated
                     dispute broke out between Andreas and one of the women in the family that evening, leading to
                     Viktoria fleeing the farm and disappearing into the surrounding woods. After hours of searching,
                     Viktoria was finally found and brought back to Hinterkaifeck.

                     The murders took place that same evening. It is believed that the family members were lured
                     one-by-one into the barn where they were systematically killed, laid in the corner, and
                     partially covered with hay. Once this had been done, the assailant(s) entered the house and killed
                     Josef Gabriel in his bassinett, and Maria in her bedchamber, whose body was found hidden beneath
                     her duvet.

                     On April 1, Simon Reißländer, a butcher and farmer, saw two mysterious figures loitering
                     at the edge of the forest around 3:00 am as he travelled past Hinterkaifeck on his way home. Upon
                     noticing the butcher, both figures turned to hide their faces. He reported his sighting to the
                     police only after hearing of the murders of Hinterkaifeck, days later.

                     missed church service. A neighbour to the Grubers, Michael Pöll would later state that he noticed
                     how quiet the house had been, noting in particular the dog's silence, which was known to bark at

                     In 2007, an investigation was performed by students of the Fürstenfeldbruck Police academy using
                     modern methods. Though they
                     concluded that the case is unlikely to ever be definitively solved due to missing evidence and
                     mishandling of the investigation, they believed they had sufficiently narrowed the suspects down to
                     one person. In respect of living relatives, their findings have never been revealed.

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     It was no secret that Andreas Gruber was something of a tyrannical patriarch. His incestuous
                     relationship with his daughter, Viktoria, was common knowledge throughout the community. Despite
                     the belief being that Viktoria was an unwilling victim to Andreas' incestual abuse towards her,
                     they were both jailed for sexual offences prior to the crime. The scandal brought much shame to
                     the family, and the Grubers were disliked by many of the region's locals.

                     No money or riches were taken from the household after the crime was committed, suggesting the
                     murders were a crime of passion as opposed to a crime of opportunity.
                     According to the timeline, an intense fight broke out between Andreas and Viktoria the night before
                     the murders took place, causing Viktoria to flee into the woods, where she disappeared for hours.
                     It was thought that the murders could be part of a suicide/murder pact between Andreas and
                     Viktoria, though it was ruled out due to the wounds inflicted on the victims not matching those of
                     a suicide.

                     It is of note that Andreas' cause of death was substantially different to the other murder victims.
                     It is believed he died from falling onto the tip of a pickaxe, later found in the animal feeding
                     trough. This in contrast to being killed with the mattock, as most of the other victims were. The
                     only other differentiation between the murders was Cäzilia Gabriel's throat had been cut with a
                     pen-knife, supposedly belonging to Andreas Gruber.

                     Lorenz Schlittenbauer, neighbour to the Gruber's, provided much of the information regarding the
                     Gruber's experiences leading up to the incident, recounting to the detectives what Andreas had told
                     him about the strange sounds heard around the property, the mysterious newspaper appearing, and the
                     footprints in the snow. Despite being forthcoming with detectives, none of Schlittenbauer's claims
                     have been corroborated by any other witnesses.

                     It was known by locals that both Andreas Gruber and Lorenz Schlittenbauer clashed
                     over several grievances. Gruber refused to allow Schlittenbauer to marry
                     his daughter, Viktoria, though Viktoria had admitted to having sexual encounters with
                     Schlittenbauer, leading him to believe that Josef Gabriel was his son.

                     It was speculated that
                     Schlittenbauer was bitter over being asked by Viktoria to revoke his testimony regarding Andreas'
                     incestuous proclivities, as well as to pay alimony for the child, despite being denied
                     access to him.

                     As a direct neighbour to the Gruber family, he also would have had extensive knowledge of the
                     layout of Hinterkaifeck. Schlittenbauer was part of the group to find the bodies of the
                     family at the farm, and fellow neighbours reported that not only did Schlittenbauer seem unphased
                     by the bodies upon their gruesome discovery, but he also moved the bodies from where they were
                     initially found, disturbing the crime scene.

                     It has also been stated that Schlittenbauer was able
                     to unlock doors due to having a key belonging to the farm. How he came
                     into possession of the key is unknown, but it's worth noting that Andreas had mentioned a key
                     vanishing prior to the murders.

                     Another interesting detail is that Schlittenbauer broke off from the search group while searching
                     and entered the house alone, with no regard to his own safety. His excuse for this was that he was
                     looking for his son, Josef.

                     In 1925, a local teacher, Hans Yblagger spotted Schlittenbauer at the site of the demolished farm.
                     Upon asking why
                     he was there, he went on to state that it was his belief that the perpetrator's attempt to bury the
                     bodies of their victims was hindered by the ground being too frozen.

                     evidence, he was sure that Adolf Gump was the legitimate father of Josef Gabriel, implicating Adolf
                     in the murder of the family as revenge for Viktoria and Andreas' incestuous relationship.

                     Adolf had already died by this time, but Popp tried catching Anton in a confession when questioning
                     him, though Anton denied everything on realising what the prosecutor's intentions were. Anton
                     was later taken into custody, but a case couldn't be made against him as it was impossible to prove
                     he participated in the crime.

                     A woman named Therese T. penned a letter in 1971 that claimed that at the age of 12 she recalled
                     seeing her mother receiving a visit from the mother of Karl and Andreas Schreier. During this
                     visit, the woman had mentioned how her sons had committed the murders at Hinterkaifeck, mentioning
                     that
                     "Andreas regretted that he lost his penknife", referencing a weapon found at the property. Some

                     owner of the weapon.

                     recalled Weber mentioning the secluded Hinterkaifeck farm and the family that lived there. When
                     Betz didn't respond to the suggestion, Weber dropped the subject and never spoke of it again. The

                     <br /><br />
                     In 2017, author Bill James penned a true crime book, <i>The Man from the Train</i>, that suggests
                     Paul Mueller of committing the murders. Mueller was a German immigrant who was living
                     in the United States, and was suspected of murdering a family in Massachusetts in 1898 among other
                     crimes. With Mueller's suspected modus operandi of murdering an entire family with a farm tool in
                     their isolated home, stacking the bodies of the victims, and ruling out robbery as a motive all
                     coinciding with those of Hinterkaifeck, James believed that the similarities between Mueller's
                     crimes and the Hinterkaifeck murders were more than coincidence.
                     <br /><br />
                     James goes on to summarise his belief that Mueller may have fled the United States for his homeland
                     of Germany around 1912 as investigators began piecing together and publicizing patterns in family
                     murders that may have led to his eventual arrest.

                     locations throughout the Bavarian region were found to have been occupied by Nazis.

                     extort the party, despite his fervor towards the Nazis. This could explain the family's wealth,
