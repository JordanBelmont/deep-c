                  <p>
                     The Smiley Face Murders is a theory revolving around the deaths of numerous young men found dead
                     in bodies of water, all located across 11 Midwestern American states beginning in 1997.
                     <br /><br />
                     Retired New York City detectives Kevin Gannon and Anthony Duarte, along with Dr. Lee Gilbertson, a
                     criminal justice professor and gang expert at St. Cloud State University, believe the men's deaths
                     were not simply cases of accidental drownings as law enforcement agencies concluded, but that they
                     were victims of one or multiple serial killers based on the similarities between each case.
                     <br /><br />
                     The theory, and subsequent naming of the theory, became connected to the cases after it
                     was made public that police had discovered graffiti of a smiley face located near where they think
                     the killer dumped the bodies in many of the cases.
                     <br /><br />
                     In a vacuum, the individual cases may seem like a suicide or accidental drowning, but it's the
                     large frequency of such cases that all share uncanny similarities, eerie circumstances, and
                     unexplainable errors from their initial investigations that raise such suspicions.

                     On February 16, 1997, Patrick McNeil disappeared after a night of drinking with his friends in
                     Manhattan's Upper East Side, a case that detective Kevin Gannon was assigned to.

                     Mississippi River in 2003, attracted the attention of both Gannon and Duarte, who discovered
                     evidence linking the case to several other similar cases across the United States, and concluded
                     that a large, organized group with a hierarchical structure is responsible for the killings. Kristi

                     Kevin Gannon first began to piece together his controversial theory regarding a spate of
                     disappearances and subsequent deaths, beginning in 1997 with his investigation of Patrick McNeil's
                     disappearance. After researching accidental drowning cases all across North America, Gannon, along
                     with Anthony Duarte and Dr. Lee Gilbertson noticed a myriad of patterns that were shared between
                     each of the victims and the circumstances surrounding their deaths. The deeper they researched, the
                     more similarities came to light, until they felt there was too much evidence for the deaths to be
                     considered a coincidence. Thus, the Smiley Face Murder theory was born.

                     a group or organisation of serial killers that had several cells spread across numerous states and
                     jurisdictions. This would allow the murders to seem completely unrelated and make it easier to
                     evade the authorities.

                     Serial killers naturally tend to be loners, or duos at best, though it is not unheard of for groups
                     of people to participate in crimes and murders. If it is to be believed that entire cartels can
                     come together under a structure to sell contraband, and if sinister organisations can put aside
                     their differences to traffic people, then perhaps it's not a far stretch to believe that a group of
                     people can come together to murder, or provide the service of murdering to others.

                     Upon forensic investigation, around 30 of the victims were found to contain high levels of
                     gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), also known as a "date rape" drug, in their systems. Side effects
                     of the drug cause drowsiness, euphoria and sedation. It is often mixed into the drinks of
                     unsuspecting victims in order to make them more pliable. Both Gannon and Duarte believe the number
                     of victims drugged with GHB could be higher, but as it is only tested for in cases where foul play
                     is suspected, and most of the cases are deduced by officials to be accidental drownings, a true
                     estimate remains inconclusive:

                     GHB is also a naturally occuring chemical that is produced throughout the body. On death, the
                     body's production of GHB can increase slightly, making the case for identifying victims being
                     drugged all the more complicated:

                     water. Gannon believes that the smiley face tag is a calling card of the Smiley Face Murders,
                     either as a rite of initiation, or a way for the group to mark their crime scenes. Gannon and
                     Gilbertson hold that the smiley tag seems to shift as it is found from region to region, adapting
                     and changing to the theosophy of that region's cell.

                     Patrick McNeil (20) was a student at Fordham University. He is considered to be the victim that
                     sparked the theory of the Smiley Face Murders.

                     On February 16, 1997, McNeil joined his friends at the Dapper Dog bar in New York City's Upper
                     East Side. His friends noted that he had become heavily intoxicated, and had been sick in
                     the bathroom of the venue, prompting McNeil to leave. He had planned to catch a ride home with a
                     friend who was present in the bar, but after they didn't show up, McNeil departed down 2nd Avenue
                     toward 90th Street.

                     Witnesses reported seeing McNeill struggle to walk after leaving the bar, leveraging himself
                     against cars and vomiting on the pavement. A van, occupied by a man and woman, that was
                     double-parked outside the bar the night McNeil disappeared was noticed by several witnesses. It
                     followed McNeil as he slowly made his way towards the subway station, stopping whenever he stopped.
                     Authorities decided not to investigate the license plate number for the van, called a "lawman
                     search", due to the cost of such a search.

                     On April 6, McNeil's body was discovered floating near Owls Head Wastewater Treatment Plant in
                     the East River, over 12 miles downriver from his last known location. McNeil was found floating on
                     his back, an unusual position for that of an accidental drowning, particularly in calm waters.
                     He was partially clothed, found only wearing his jeans, underwear and socks. Ligature marks were
                     found on McNeil's neck, and his head, hands and torso showed signs of charring, which the autopsy
                     report stated was decomposition due to exposure. His blood alcohol concentration level upon
                     recovery was 0.16. McNeil's death was ruled an accidental drowning, but the manner of his death was
                     left undetermined.

                     in water, then it would have been moist and attractive to flies and they would have laid their eggs
                     there. Instead, this area was burnt to the point of charring (hard and dry) which made it
                     unsuitable to flies as a location to lay eggs. Subsequently, they laid their eggs in the most
                     desirable and exposed location that they could find, his groin area.

                     Second, had Pat actually fallen into the East River where he then died, then his groin area would
                     have been underneath his boxers and immersed in water. Simply put, the flies could not have gotten
                     there once Pat was in the water.

                     Third, flies do not lay eggs on a deceased human body in temperatures under 50 °Fahrenheit,
                     especially in the moving water of New York City's East River or the Upper New York Bay at night
                     with temperatures in the 40s (like when Pat went missing). The suspicious location of the fly eggs
                     (i.e., in Pat's groin area underneath his boxers and immersed in water) should have been a red
                     flag.

                     landscaper until an injury put his work on hold. Andrews suffered tragedy when in 1994, his

                     On December 31, 1997, Andrews and a group of his friends journeyed from Brewster, New York to Times
                     Square to celebrate the new year. The plan for the group was to board the commuter train to Grand
                     Central Terminal, and head back some time after the ball dropped in Times Square. The group arrived
                     at Grand Central Terminal around 10:30 PM, drinking en route to their destination. After arriving,
                     the group stopped off at a number of bars along 42nd Street, finishing off at Houlihan's before
                     stepping outside to usher in the new year at Times Square. Some time during the night, Andrews
                     became separated from his friends and disappeared.

                     telephone number. Andrews' parents spent the night of February 11, 1998, attempting to retrace the
                     steps of their son.

                     from the train station, in his T-shirt, between 2:00 and 2:30 AM. Witnesses described Andrews as
                     drunk, but coherent.

                     his system, a drug commonly used for cold symptoms. The coroner determined that the cause of death
                     was drowning, but the manner in which he died, be it suicide, accident, or homicide, was left
                     undetermined.

                     personnel, they found it near impossible for Andrews to have fallen into the water and floated 9
                     miles from the Hudson without sustaining any injuries.

                     Gannon and Gilbertson's analysis of the autopsy photos garnered a different conclusion from that of
                     the original medical examiner's. Bruising of the eyes, similar to that of having ones nose broken,
                     was left out of the original report; skin slippage, discoloration, and marbling were all
                     exaggerated in the original report; and details, such as a lack of Washerwoman's Hands and lack of
                     putrefaction and decay would all insinuate that Andrews' body was not submerged in water for as
                     long as the police suspected. Fluorescent orange flecks were discovered, along with hairs of those
                     resembling an Alaskan Husky were also identified in the autopsy photographs, both of which were not
                     mentioned or sampled by the medical examiner.

                  <p>
                     Said by those closest to have had an infectious smile, Nathan Kapfer (19) was a student of Viterbo
                     College in La Crosse, Wisconsin. He was a well educated student, being a member of the National
                     Honor Society and a scholarship recipient, as well as keeping active by fishing, hunting and
                     playing football.

                     <br /><br />
                     On February 21, 1998, Kapfer attended a house party of a friend, arriving around 6:00 PM. Kapfer
                     DJ'd the party until leaving sometime between 11:00 PM and 11:30 PM to head to The Library bar.
                     Arriving at 12:00 AM, February 22, Kapfer shared a number of drinks with friends while at the bar,
                     specifically Long Island Iced Teas. At around 1:30 AM, Kapfer and some friends left to head over to
                     Brother's Bar and Grill, a short distance from The Library. Not long after arriving, Kapfer was
                     escorted out of the bar for being overintoxicated, and proceeded to shout vulgarities and make lewd
                     gestures towards the bouncers. Police arrived on the scene at around 1:42 AM, and after discovering
                     he was underage and using a friend's ID, they gave him a breathalyzer test with the result
                     recording as a 0.077 blood alcohol concentration. Kapfer was considered sober enough to drive, so
                     after issuing him four citations, the police released him at an intersection, and watched him walk
                     east along Pearl Street. Kapfer was said to have then spoken to friends near Coconut Joe's on Pearl
                     Street before leaving north on 3rd Street South at 2:30 AM.

                     <br /><br />
                     On February 23, Kapfer's wallet, hat, keys and the four citations he received were all found neatly
                     placed on the deck of the La Crosse Queen Gift Shop near the Chief Hiawatha statue in Riverside
                     Park. This led investigators to believe that Kapfer had taken a route through Riverside Park and
                     laid his personal effects to be discovered, insinuating that he may have been considering suicide.
                     On discovery of the items, the La Crosse Fire Department searched the area for Kapfer's body, but
                     were unsuccessful. On February 24, the water in the nearby area was searched, but again, the search
                     turned up empty. On February 25, police approached Brother's Bar to try to gain access to the CCTV
                     footage from the night Kapfer went missing, with the footage clearly showing Kapfer entering and
                     being escorted back out of the bar. On March 3, The Library was approached for their footage, but
                     it had already been recorded over by the time police got to it:

                     According to bouncers working at Brother's Bar who were interviewed regarding the night of Kapfer's
                     disappearance, Kapfer was struggling to keep his balance and was drunk enough that he was unable to
                     tell the difference between his driver's license and university ID card. A bartender gave him a
                     drink of water, but Kapfer became irate, was dry heaving, and was then escorted out of the bar.
                     Other witnesses claimed to have seen Kapfer on the night in question, including someone who
                     reported seeing a young man standing on a bridge, staring into the waters of the La Crosse River at
                     around 1:00 AM, while another witness claimed he may have been the intoxicated young man who had
                     walked with him at 6:00 AM to Hardee's, though due to the timeline of events and inconsistencies in
                     Kapfer's situation, these were not likely to have been Kapfer. A friend of Kapfer's who was also
                     out on the same night reported an incident in which he described being stalked by someone driving a
                     dark-coloured truck as he headed home, shortly after Kapfer and his other friends left The Library
                     for Brother's Bar. The car followed Kapfer's friend slowly before crossing his path, cutting
                     through the nearby Wells Fargo Banks parking lot, then waiting for him at a stop sign nearby. The
                     friend fled the scene and didn't see the car again, and police didn't follow up an investigation
                     into it.

                     Kapfer's body was discovered on April 4 at 3:00 PM, though reports differ on the exact location of
                     his discovery. One report stated his body had been recovered at out of the main channel of the
                     Mississippi River in Running Slough, with another described as near a gravel pit in Running Slough,
                     and one final report stating near the 3200 block of East Avenue South in the town of Shelby. Kapfer
                     was found floating against a mass of debris, with everything but his head and upper torso submerged
                     in the water. According to the toxicology report, Kapfer's blood alcohol concentration level was
                     0.22. He also had small amounts of phenethylamine and n-propanol in his system, though the police
                     reported that no drugs had been found, later correcting to say no drugs that had contributed to
                     Kapfer's death were found. Kapfer's death was ruled as an accidental drowning, though the manner
                     remained undetermined.

                     On recovery of Kapfer's body, it was reported that insects covered portions of the body, though
                     there was no record or examination of the insects by the medical examiner. Since insects are often
                     attracted to warm corpses, it was an oddity that they would be attracted to Kapfer's frozen-solid
                     body, suggesting they nested on his body while he was on land. Similarly, sand and mud found on the
                     body were mostly ignored, while an analysis of both could help determine where Kapfer entered the
                     water.

                  <p>
                     Having been raised in Sunday school and a devoted follower of Jesus, Jeffrey Geesey (21) became a
                     student at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse.

                     <br /><br />
                     On April 10, 1999, Geesey had let the manager of a Taco Bell know he was heading to a girl's
                     apartment on Pine Street to attend a house party. Geesey walked to the party, and after leaving,
                     headed to Big Al's pizzeria with the girl, her father and two other friends that Geesey had not met
                     before. At around 10:30 PM, the girl and her father left to go home, with the remaining three
                     heading to the Bodega Brew Pub, where Geesey was introduced to another friend at 11:30 PM. A
                     bartender gave Geesey some free drinks as he had run out of money. The group were heavily
                     intoxicated by this point, and details of location and time get confusing.

                     Witness statements from the friends who were with Geesey were conflicting, as due to intoxication
                     and heavy rain, they couldn't recall which bar they were in at certain times, placing Geesey in
                     several locations at different times. According to their timeframe, the gang all stayed at the
                     Bodega Brew Pub until around midnight before heading to Club Millennium and sharing a pitcher of
                     beer. At around 1:00 AM, April 11, two of the friends left to head home, another left for The
                     Library, while Geesey was said to have stayed at Club Millennium, speaking with a woman he had met
                     there, until closing. However, witnesses from Millennium Bar had not noticed Geesey, despite the
                     bar's clientele being mostly black, and Geesey being white. The owner of Club Millennium mentioned
                     that the occupants of the apartments above the club often threw their keys down to people once the
                     bar closed, encouraging them to come and continue the party upstairs.

                     The body of Geesey was discovered at 8:15 AM on May 24, floating in an inlet of the Mississippi
                     River. His body was caught on river debris near a gravel pit. Authorities struggled to recover the
                     body due to the debris, so his body was pulled to an adjacent island before being recovered.

                     The toxicology report indicated that Geesey's blood alcohol concentration level was 0.420, as well
                     as revealing that GHB was in his system, though no signs of trauma were noted. The medical examiner
                     had concluded that the cause of death was likely drowning. Four shallow, self-inflicted scars on
                     Geesey's arms gave authorities the impression that it may have been suicide, however, friends and
                     family insisted that the scars were not from a genuine suicide attempt and was a call for help.

                     K9 units were brought in on May 27 to try and trace Geesey's movements to him ending in the river.
                     A heavy scent was picked up in The Library bar, but not at Club Millennium. From The Library, the
                     scent led to the interior of a pickup truck parked in the front of the bar, a blue Ford Ranger
                     pickup belonging to one of the occupiers of the apartments above Club Millennium who often
                     frequented The Library. Similarly, a scent was picked up in a Plymouth minivan that was parked in
                     the alley between Big Al's and Club Millennium, belonging to a female that also frequented The
                     Library. A scent was traced leading up to the 2nd floor apartments above Club Millennium, down a
                     set of stairs, through an alley, across to Shooter's Bar and out of the back door, on to the
                     Radisson Hotel and ended in Riverside Park near the Mississippi River.

                     It was summarised by Gannon and Gilbertson that Geesey had not been to Club Millennium on the night
                     of his disappearance, but had most likely been to The Library. Due to the high levels of alcohol
                     and GHB, Geesey could not have walked anywhere in such a state, and was likely taken via car. Added
                     with the fact that the condition of the body was not that of one that had been in a river for over
                     30 days, foul play was the clear conclusion:

                     Known as an athletic and intelligent student, Brian Welzien (21) was a finance major who played

                     DJing at. Welzien and his friends checked in to the Ambassador East Hotel before heading to Irish
                     Eyes, a pub in North Lincoln. Welzien was noted to have only had a couple of Long Island Iced Teas,
                     but was visibly intoxicated:

                     At around 2:00 AM, Cain drove Welzien, who wanted to leave, back to the hotel. Young and Wittrup
                     decided to go on to another bar and caught a taxi. At the hotel entrance, Welzien proceeded to
                     vomit twice before managing to climb out of the car. Cain parked two blocks away, and upon
                     returning, noted that there was no sign of Welzien, but assuming he had entered the hotel, Cain
                     shrugged it off and went to his own room. When Young and Wittrup returned to the hotel at 4:00 AM,
                     they noticed that Welzien was nowhere to be found, and after searching the area around the hotel
                     for a bit, they learned that the doorman wouldn't let Welzien inside the hotel in the state he was
                     in. Waking at around 1:00 PM the following day, they saw that Welzien still hadn't returned, and
                     reported him missing to the police.

                     According to the coroner's report, the body had undergone slight to moderate decomposition, was

                     detective who worked on Welzien's case. He stated that this was the only time in his 29-year career
                     working for the Gary Police Department that a body disappeared in Chicago and washed up in Gary.
                     Additionally, he felt that the condition of the body was suspicious:

                     showed on his back, as well as the level of preservation of his organs, was not conducive with
                     drifting on the water for 77 days. In his opinion, Welzien was deceased before entering the water.

                     Thought of as outgoing and popular by both friends and family, Christopher Jenkins (21) was a
                     senior at the University of Minnesota, where he majored in business, and saw success as the goalie
                     on the school's lacrosse team.

                     On October 31, 2002, Jenkins was out celebrating Halloween with friends, dressed in a costume as
                     a Native American. After leaving a keg party, Jenkins and his friends set out to a bar in downtown
                     Minneapolis, arriving at the Lone Tree Bar & Grill around 10:30 PM. Sometime around 12:30 AM,
                     Jenkins was ejected from the bar. Wearing only his costume and without his keys, phone or wallet,
                     Jenkins was forced into the cold night, with the bouncer noting that Jenkins had turned left down
                     Hennepin Avenue.

                     On November 1, Jenkins' family reported him missing to the Minneapolis Police Department, but due
                     to Jenkins being over the age of 18, he could not be considered missing for three days, so his
                     family took matters into their own hands. His mother organised a search party with many showing up
                     to assist in the search. The downtown area, as well as the bridges over the Mississippi River, were
                     plastered with missing posters. According to Jenkin's family, the police and FBI didn't take the
                     case seriously, only joining the search five days after Jenkins had gone missing.

                     It was revealed that during the
                     night, Jenkins had broken up an altercation that started during the night between two other men
                     before accidentally spilling his drink over himself. An off-duty police officer working security,
                     assuming the spill mark was a sign that Jenkins had urinated himself, ejected him from the bar.
                     Police evidence would later show that the head bouncer of the Lone Tree Bar & Grill vehemently
                     denied removing Jenkins from the property, with the remaining bouncers subsequently becoming
                     defensive and providing no further information. Surveillance footage from the Hennepin Avenue
                     Bridge was reviewed with no evidence showing Jenkins crossing the bridge. The Jenkins family went
                     on to hire K9 units, which discovered Jenkins' scent leading to a parking facility next door to the
                     Lone Tree Bar & Grill, as well as near the Mississippi River at Nicollet Island. On November 8,
                     police searched Nicollet Island, the Horseshoe Dam area, and the Mississippi River area, with a
                     follow up search conducted on November 11, but to no avail. According to Jenkins' mother, police
                     were convinced that he had jumped from a bridge into the Mississippi River due to an argument with
                     his girlfriend.

                     was one that had been checked numerous times. Jenkins' body would later float to the lip of the
                     Horseshoe Dam where it would be caught on a tree. His body was encased in ice, found floating on
                     his back, with his arms crossed over his upper torso, and his hands clenched, something Loesch
                     found to be particularly strange:

                     A toxicology report showed that Jenkins' blood alcohol concentration was at 0.12. The Minneapolis
                     Police went on to declare the death to be an accidental drowning.

                     Despite the case being officially closed, the Jenkins family continued their own investigation.
                     According to Jenkins' mother, a neighbour of the Jenkins family that taught forensics reviewed the
                     autopsy photographs and discovered a clump of hair in Jenkins' hand. A test on the hair showed that
                     it belonged to Jenkins himself. Oddly, Jenkins' body presented no bruising despite being a lacrosse
                     goalie and often being covered in bruises, suggesting he had been out of the water long enough to
                     heal, perhaps days or weeks. Forensic Pathologist, Michael Baden, pointed out that drowning victims
                     often have dishevelled clothes, while Jenkins was found with his shirt tucked into his trousers,
                     and his oversized moccasins still on his feet.

                     In 2006, then Police Chief, Tim Dolan, believed Jenkins' death to not have been investigated
                     properly, with no supporting evidence of a suicide, and a possible confession by a prison inmate,
                     and subsequently reopened the case. The medical examiner ultimately altered the cause of death from
                     an accidental drowning to a homicide, with the police determining that Jenkins had been thrown from
                     the Hennepin Avenue Bridge into the Mississippi River, a theory Investigative Reporter, Kristi

                     In their 2014 book, <i>Case Studies in Drowning Forensics</i>, Gannon and Gilbertson stated that,
                     based on the evidence, they believed that Jenkins was murdered before entering the water, was
                     posed, and then placed on his back in the water to be found.
                     <br /><br />
                     In April, 2016, Jenkin's mother spoke on The Opperman Report' podcast where she revealed that a
                     prison inmate confessed to having witnessed the murder of Jenkins, but that she had not tried to
                     contact him. She went on to state that she believed her son may be a victim of the smiley face

                     In 2018, the TV show <i>Breaking Homicide</i> covered Jenkins' death, hosted by former police

                     met with a source that requested to remain anonymous. The source revealed that he had previously
                     been to the Lone Tree Bar & Grill with friends around the same time Jenkins had gone missing, and
                     after buying drinks, noticed that they had a funny, metallic taste to them. Shortly after, he
                     started to feel the effects of what he believes to have been drugs:

                     Criminologist, Dallas Drake, refuted the idea that Jenkins was a victim of the Smiley Face Murders,
                     reasoning that the correlation between all the murders was simply down to young men drinking
                     alcohol and ending up in a nearby body of water.

                     An accomplished wrestler who liked to keep fit, Jared Dion (21) was a freshman at the University of
                     Wisonsin-La Crosse.
                     <br /><br />
                     On April 9, 2004, Dion planned on going out with friends in the evening, arriving in downtown La
                     Crosse at around 11:30 PM. Around 2:20 AM on April 10, Dion and a friend stood outside of John's
                     bar, attempting to catch a ride back to campus on the Safe Ride bus, which was provided by the
                     University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. Dion suggested getting another drink, which his friend objected
                     to and boarded the bus. Dion did not get on the Safe Travel bus, and instead headed back inside
                     John's bar just before closing. This was the last time Dion was seen alive.
                     <br /><br />
                     On April 14, an individual found Dion's baseball cap while jogging in Riverside Park. The cap was
                     hanging neatly on a pole near the statue of Chief Hiawatha. The jogger stated that he often ran
                     that route, and had only seen the cap on the pole on April 14. Despite this, police claimed that
                     the jogger had found the cap and hung it on the pole himself.
                     <br /><br />
                     According to a member of the band that played at John's bar that night, Dion was seen talking to a
                     person with blonde hair. Dion had also mentioned to a band member that he was planning on attending
                     an after-hours party.
                     <br /><br />
                     Dion's body was found by the La Crosse Dive and Rescue Team as well as the La Crosse Fire
                     Department on April 15, floating in the Mississippi River, 30 feet from shore. The body was found
                     by tracking Dion's phone. The location where the body was found varied between sources, with some
                     stating it was recovered by Riverside Park, 99 State Street, or 322 Front Street South. Dion's
                     blood alcohol concentration was initially reported at a level of 0.40, but was later changed to
                     0.27. He also had GHB in his system. The report concluded that Dion had died of drowning, with
                     alcohol as a determining factor, while the manner of death was left undetermined.
                     <br /><br />
                     On April 22, the police addressed the issue of river drownings in the area at a meeting for local
                     students. During the meeting, they emphasised the need for responsibility when drinking, and
                     assured locals that a serial killer or killers were not responsible for the deaths.

                     On February 23, 2008, the Dion family received an anonymous letter from someone claiming to have
                     seen Dion on the night he disappeared:

                     Dear Bryan and Kim Dion,
                     <br /><br />
                     This has taken me a lot of guts to write this letter. What has happened to your son has haunted
                     me for years. I even told some of the La Crosse police officers on the street, but because I was a
                     collage [sic] student at the time, my word meant nothing. I said something to my friends, and
                     they told me I did all I could and that is all I can do.
                     <br /><br />
                     The night that your son disappeared, I was walking home from work going home. By the Dell's Bar on
                     third [sic] and Vine Street walking east home. By the courthouse on the bench was your son all
                     passed out from drinking. There were a few people 7 or ten people that looked in there [sic] young
                     20's. They picked your son up and I watched them for a block as they carried him towards Riverside
                     Park. I did not think about it at the time that this was going to happen. I thought they all knew
                     one another and for the fact that there was one of me and more of them. I also did not say one word
                     to them. After the one block, I turned around and continued walking home in the opposite direction
                     they were heading. It did not dawn in my head until I heard the news and has haunted me quite bad
                     since. I now there is nothing I can do. This is the only way I think I can get this off my
                     conscious and bring peace that the truth be told.
                     <br /><br />
                     Sincerely,
                     <br />

                     Adam Falcon
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     An excellent soccer player for saint Lawrence University in Canton, New York, Adam Falcon (20) was
                     a philosophy major who coached kids' summer camps.
                     <br /><br />
                     On the night of November 12, 2004, Falcon and his friends headed out to attend a number of
                     locations that evening. At around 9:15 PM, Falcon arrived at a themed "Around the World" party
                     taking place across three Dean Eaton dormitories. At around 10:00 PM, the group moved on to the
                     next stop of the night, the Coffee House, before Falcon and two of his friends departed for the
                     Hoot Owl Bar at 11:00 PM. Falcon was denied access by a bouncer at the bar, who realised he was
                     using a fake ID card, so the friends all decided to go back to the Dean Eaton dormitory party,
                     likely around 11:30 PM. Adam, and one of his friends, James Merrill, left the party at 12:30 AM on
                     November 13, to head downtown to the Tick Tock Inn. Falcon was granted access to the "Over 21"
                     section using his fake ID, while his friend, Merrill gained access via the "Underage" door of the
                     bar, with both being served alcohol once inside. At 1:45 AM, the bar's clientele had mostly cleared
                     out, and by 2:15 AM, the bar locked up for the night.
                     <br /><br />
                     It wasn't until Falcon had failed to show up to a soccer championship game on the afternoon of
                     November 13 that his coach and team suspected he was missing and began looking for him. Friends and
                     family all helped to search for Falcon, joined by local emergency service personnel, the St.
                     Lawrence County Underwater Recovery team and forest rangers. Falcon's cell phone and cap were
                     recovered several blocks from the Tick Tock Inn, with the cap being discovered behind a wire fence
                     across a parking lot, and the phone on the porch of a church rectory. K9 dogs caught Falcon's
                     scent trailing through the back door of the Tick Tock Inn and to the rear parking lot where the
                     scent ended.
                     <br /><br />
                     According to witnesses, Falcon was last seen leaving the Tick Tock Inn at around 1:30 AM, just
                     before the rest of the clientele had all left. A Canton couple also mentioned seeing a
                     light-coloured vehicle approaching someone fitting Falcon's description on Chapel Street before
                     approaching him again on Court Street, the corner of which houses the church rectory that Falcon's
                     phone was discovered at. Falcon was said to have gotten into the back seat of the vehicle.
                     <br /><br />
                     On November 18, Falcon's body was discovered with the help of K9 units that led searchers to an
                     area of the Grasse River in Canton. Divers found an underwater footprint, and shortly after, found
                     Falcon's body in a 7-feet deep sink hole. The body was found lying on its side, and retained all
                     clothing but the trousers. The autopsy report revealed Falcon died from drowning and hypothermia,
                     though the manner of death was left undetermined. The toxicology report showed that Falcon's blood
                     alcohol concentration was at a level of 0.21. Ultimately, Falcon's death was ruled an accident with
                     no signs of foul play. A theory posited by the New York Federation of Search and Rescue Teams, was
                     that Falcon passed out after consuming copious amounts of alcohol, and upon wakening, was under the
                     effects of hypothermia (due to the cold weather) causing him to feel hot, he then tried to cool off
                     in the river and drowned.
                     <br /><br />
                     Falcon was one of several cases referenced in the 2014 book <i>Case Studies in Drowning
                        Forensics</i>, where Gannon and Gilbertson analysed his case for themselves. During their
                     investigation, they discovered a number of inconsistencies, particularly with evidence being
                     found, scents being picked up, and the body being recovered, all in areas that had already been
                     thoroughly searched:

                     a tracking dog to follow.

                     Personal property associated with Adam kept turning up within areas that had been previously

                     The hat appeared to have been found in a distant location from any of Falcon's destinations the
                     night he disappeared, and the church rectory porch had been searched thoroughly by Falcon's uncle
                     to no success, only for Falcon's phone to turn up in the corner of the porch days later.

                  <p>
                     Strangely, the K9 dogs used in the search caught no scent of Falcon leading to his personal items,
                     and though authorities claimed to have used the K9 units near the water, they stated that there
                     were no traces of a scent. A Massasauga Search and Rescue tracking dog apparently did pick up a
                     scent near the island in the middle of the river on the bank opposite of where Adam was eventually
                     found, but Forest Rangers were said to have disregarded this lead.
                     <br /><br />
                     The underwater footprints that were found by the regional rescue diver team led directly to the
                     sink hole to where Falcon's body was eventually discovered. Witnesses stated that the tracks did
                     not resemble those created by sneakers akin to the ones Falcon had been wearing, but by regular
                     shoes. Witnesses on the scene used a stick to measure the shoe size and sketch out a drawing of the
                     shoe print which was then handed off to a forest ranger, but the drawing was never seen again.
                     According to the police, anybody could have made the tracks, and they could have been made at any
                     time, so they were ignored.
                  </p>

                  <blockquote class="quote mx-6 text-justify">
                     The tracks had obviously not been there as long as Adam had been missing. If they had been there
                     the whole time, then the flowing water would have erased them.
                     <br /><br />
                     Preservation measures should have been taken. As is standard operating procedure in a suspicious
                     missing person case, the police usually make some effort to preserve prints and impressions made by
                     feet or footwear (photographs, artist's rendering, or casts/molds) even if they eventually turn out
                     to be the victim's.

                     unlikeliness of investigators missing the trousers in such a thorough sweep the previous day:

                     Todd Geib
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     An avid fan of the outdoors, Todd Geib (22) worked at Hager Distribution, Inc, in Wyoming. He was
                     fun-loving and generally quite popular.
                     <br /><br />
                     On June 11, 2005, Geib set out to meet his friends at the Half Moon Bar & Grill. At around 9:30 PM,
                     they all left the bar, and drove to an all-night bonfire party in an apple orchard near White Road
                     in Casnovia, Michigan. Witnesses claim that as the night drew on, the party started to get out of
                     hand, with fights threatening to break out. At around 12:45 AM, Geib informed his friends that he
                     had had enough and was going to walk the 1.5 miles home. At 12:47 AM, Geib spoke on the phone to
                     his friend who had driven them all to the party to let him know he was on his way home, was
                     alright, but he had just had enough. At 12:51 AM, Geib made a series of phone calls to a friend.
                     During these calls, he mentioned twice that he was in a field, he said he was lost, and that he
                     couldn't breathe, followed by the sound of heavy breathing before the call got abruptly cut off.
                     <br /><br />
                     By the afternoon of June 12, Geib's family were out looking for him, with a more organised effort
                     taking place on June 13, though no trace of Geib was found. Michigan State Police quickly took over
                     investigation of the case, with Muskegon County only assisting, despite it being in their
                     jurisdiction. As the search continued, police dogs caught Geib's scent, tracing it from the
                     location of the party on June 11 to White Road, where it turned east to M37 and suddenly ended.
                     The search for Geib was temporarily suspended, but continued on June 18, where a volunteering force
                     of 1,500 people including helicopters set out to find him, to no avail. Further searches were
                     called off, as Michigan State Police began to suspect foul play, believing that Geib may have been
                     hit by a car as he was walking home on the night of the party. Police informed Geib's family of
                     their suspicions that Todd had been the victim of a hit-and-run and may have been buried sometime
                     around June 22. Police began their investigations into witnesses, and still leaning on the theory
                     of being hit by a car, they even began investigating cars that had been brought in for repairs
                     around that time.
                     <br /><br />
                     A break in the case occured on July 2, when the Wilde's headed out on their boat across Ovidhall
                     Lake, a lake in the opposite direction of Geib's home and where the tracker dogs traced Geib's
                     scent to. The couple discovered Geib's body around 60 feet from shore, where he was found nearly
                     vertical, with his head slumped over on one arm.

                     The autopsy report stated that Geib's body was only moderately decomposed, he had no external
                     injuries, and he had a blood alcohol concentraion level of 0.12, as well as large quantities of
                     amitriptyline and desipramine in his system, both of which Todd was not prescribed. The manner of
                     his death was ruled as undetermined, while the cause of death was concluded as an accidental
                     drowning, despite there being no water found in Geib's lungs. Police considered the case closed,
                     concluding that on the night of June 11, Geib had become intoxicated at the party and left,
                     stumbling drunkenly into the lake and drowning.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 2009, Over 200 medical examiners at a medical conference took a look into the case and gave
                     their opinions, stating that they did not believe the cause of death was accidental drowning, and
                     believed that, based on body decomposition, Todd was alive 2 to 5 days before being found in the
                     lake. Following this, a letter was composed and sent to the Michigan State Police imploring that
                     the case be reopened and investigated as a homicide based on overwhelming evidence, but this was
                     quickly rejected and discounted as evidence. In 2012, Geib's mother rallied to have the case
                     reopened, but this was once again rejected. She heard about the investigations Gannon and Duarte
                     were heading and, noticing the similarities, contacted them regarding her son. Shortly after, a
                     smiley face sticker was found on Geib's grave, with another smiley face spray painted on a tree
                     close to where Geib's body being found.
                     <br /><br />
                     Further investigation by Gannon and Duarte during the 2019 TV Series, <i>Smiley Face Killers: The
                        Hunt for Justice</i>, revealed a number of new factors to the case.
                     Jim Wilde, the man who found Geib's body, stated that he had tied his canoe up, but found it
                     floating out on the lake filled with beer cans before they discovered Todd's body. Additionally,
                     his brother had been out fishing the previous night, and despite being in the same part of the
                     lake, Todd's body was not seen.

                  Photographs from the scene were presented to Forensic Biologist, Dr M. Eric Benbow, who felt that
                  Geib's body would have shown signs of aquatic insect colonization and more algae presence on his

                  <p>
                     Considered one of the only survivors of a supposed Smiley Face Killer encounter. Cullen Fortney
                     (21) was a student at the University of Wisconsin.
                     <br /><br />
                     On the evening of January 7, 2006, Fortney was driving to downtown La Crosse, Wisconsin after
                     picking up some friends for a night out. The trio arrived at John's Bar, with Fortney last seen
                     dancing at 1:45 AM January 8.
                     <br /><br />
                     Fortney later stated that he didn't remember anything after leaving the bar, leading up to the
                     moment he found himself in the cold Mississippi River. Fortney swam with the current and finally
                     managed to pull himself ashore before collapsing with exhaustion. Eventually, Fortney regained
                     consciousness and, following the sounds of the morning traffic, found his way to the Gundersen
                     Lutheran Medical Center at around 7:00 AM where he reported that someone had tried
                     to kill him.
                     <br /><br />
                     The police requested a blood analysis for Fortney, with the results showing he had a blood alcohol
                     concentration of 0.043. Police summised that a drunken Fortney entered the water after John's Bar
                     closed, at around 2:00 AM, though based on the cold temperatures of the water, this does seem
                     unlikely:

                     If the police say that Cullen entered the water sometime after bar closing at 02:00 hours, then he
                     would have been dead by 03:00 hours as a result of 32 °Fahrenheit water and hypothermia. He would
                     not have been alive to walk into the hospital some 4 hours later.

                     Whether by coincidence or not, a friend of Fortney's who was also at John's Bar that same evening
                     had trouble recollecting the events that took place that night. His only recollection was going to
                     John's Bar and waking up later in the lobby of the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center with no idea
                     how he got there.
                     <br /><br />
                     With Fortney having survived, police closed the case, simply believing it to be an accident,

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     Lucas "Luke" Homan (21) was a successful sports athlete, specialising in both basketball and
                     football. His prowess in the latter earned him a spot on the team at the University of Wisconsin,
                     La Crosse, leading them to numerous wins.
                     <br /><br />
                     On September 29, 2006, Homan was out celebrating Oktoberfest with friends in downtown La Crosse,
                     Wisconsin at a bar called The Vibe. Before 10:00 PM, his friends left the bar, having not
                     seen Homan since 9:00 or 9:30 PM and assuming he had already left. The following morning, Homan
                     didn't show up to a planned golf outing, and with the eventual discovery of his mobile phone
                     beneath his bed, his friends reported Homan as missing.
                     <br /><br />
                     Of the interviewed witnesses, Austin Scott, a freshman at UW-La Crosse, stated that at around 12:30
                     AM, Homan had gotten into a verbal altercation with three men at the bar, causing him to leave. On
                     further inspection, the statement was proven to be false, with story alterations and conflicting
                     witness reports nullifying the validity of his claims. In reality, Scott had been cited at
                     Riverside Park and had been detained for underage drinking, proving his story had been completely
                     fabricated. He was also discovered with a head wound.
                     <br /><br />
                     After bringing in police dogs, Homan's scent led them to Riverside Park, where his body was
                     found nearby at the bottom of the Mississippi River. An orange smiley face was discovered spray
                     painted on the asphalt of a nearby road.
                     <br /><br />
                     According to the autopsy reports, Homan had bruises and abrasions on his biceps, knuckles, and
                     torso, as well as epidurmal blisters on his wrists, and scratches and a pressure wound on his
                     forehead. Detective Mike Donovan noted that these particular wounds were comparative to those of
                     someone having been in a fight.

                     with his blood alcohol concentration at a level of 0.32. Authorities deemed Homan's death as an
                     accidental cold water drowning, with police deducing that Homan drunkenly stumbled into the river,
                     with his injuries caused by tripping on a rock and travel abrasions while in the water.

                     fluorescent orange material that experts identified as a type of nail polish:

                     After evaluating photographs from the case, Forensic Toolmark Annalyst, William Moore, remarked
                     that the abrasions on Homan's forehead may have been caused by a boot applying pressure, suggesting
                     foul play.

                     Thomas Booth
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     Described by his family as a kind, respectful young man, Thomas "Tommy" Booth (24) was from
                     Wilmington, Delaware where he worked as a master drywaller. He suffered from epilepsy, and was
                     prescribed a myriad of medications, including alprazolam (a benzodiazepine), to help him cope with
                     his disorder.
                     <br /><br />
                     On January 19, 2008, Booth and a group of friends set out in three separate vehicles to celebrate a
                     friend's 21st birthday at Bootlegger's Bar in Woodlyn, Pennsylvania. Arriving just before 11:00 PM,
                     all nine friends were captured on surveillance camera entering the bar. At around 12:45 AM, two
                     members of the group were ejected from the bar for smoking marijuana, and at 12:52 AM, most of the
                     friends left, leaving only Booth and the friend who drove him at the bar. Between 1:00 and 2:00 AM,
                     Booth disappeared, despite not having been seen leaving the bar on the surveillance camera.
                     <br /><br />
                     On January 20, Booth's family filed a missing persons report before investigating the area around
                     Bootlegger's Bar themselves. A winter storm had hit the area shortly after Booth's disappearance,
                     so two days later, on January 22, the family walked along Ridley Creek, located directly behind
                     Bootlegger's Bar, concerned that Booth may have fallen through and been trapped underneath. The
                     authorities brought in police dogs, but caught no scent of Booth. By February 2, the temperature
                     had increased, and a friend of the Booth's, William Derr, decided to walk along the creek now that
                     the ice had all thawed, but still found no sign of him.

                     I didn't see anything at all.

                     Witness reports and interviews conducted offered a mixture of contradictory statements. Much of the
                     information given to police by Booth's friends was either inconsistent with one another, was
                     changed several times, or was proven false by other witnesses. Despite this, the police did not
                     bring anybody in for further questioning, and avoided questioning some witnesses altogether.
                     <br /><br />
                     On February 3, search teams discovered the body of Booth in Ridley Creek, face down on the opposite
                     bank from Bootlegger's Bar. The body was in a state of rigor mortis, suggesting that Booth had not
                     been in the river the entire time he had been missing.

                     According to the autopsy report, Tommy was recovered in full rigor, completely stiff, which means
                     that Tommy was dead for less than 24 hours.

                     His body was positioned with his arms flexed inwards across his chest, with broken branches that
                     looked to have been placed protruding from the mud bank, holding his body in place by the armpit
                     and groin. A set of bootprints were found in the mud nearby, which were not analysed or catalogued
                     as evidence by the police. Drag marks were noted leading to the body's head, with mud caked on
                     Booth's face and upper body, but not on his legs, suggesting Booth had been dragged by his legs.
                     Graffiti of a smiley face was found behind Bootlegger's Bar, where Booth was last seen, with
                     another found later replacing the previous one after it was painted over.
                     <br /><br />
                     The autopsy report revealed that Booth's body was in good condition, with the only area showing any
                     form of decomposition being the lower right portion of his abdomen. Police determined the lack of
                     decomposition was due to Booth being submerged in frozen water, slowing the process of
                     decomposition, something Dr. Lee Gilbertson refuted:

                     Superficial injuries were found on the front side of the body, with knee wounds and his chest
                     showing a red colouration, suggesting they were caused pre-mortem, while the head and face wounds
                     were colourless, suggesting they were caused post-mortem. The only other wound was found on the
                     back of his hand, which resembled that of a cigarette burn. The toxicology report revealed that
                     Booth had a blood alcohol concentration at a level of 0.22, as well as 0.01mg of alprazolam per ml
                     of blood in his system. Booth's cause of death was concluded as an accidental drowning despite
                     there being no water being found in his lungs, and the manner of death was left undetermined,
                     though the doctor in charge would later go on to state that the circumstances around Booth's death
                     and recovery were suspicious. Captain Scott Willoughby, a detective at the time, informed the Booth
                     family that their investigation had ruled out foul play, and it was likely that Booth had
                     accidentally drowned in Ridley Creek while intoxicated.

                     In 2019, Gannon and Duarte reinvestigated the case for the TV Series, <i>Smiley Face Killers: The
                        Hunt for Justice</i>. During their investigation, additional details about his background and
                     events leading up to Booth's death
                     came from his family. According to his mother, Booth had received a troubling phone call from
                     someone where it sounded like he was trying to resolve a heated issue. He had also made it clear to
                     his uncle, Brad Booth, that he was thinking of moving to Florida, and on one occassion had
                     mentioned to his mother that he wasn't going to be around much longer.

                     Crime Scene Reconstruction Expert, Scott Roder, built a CGI model from the physical and forensic
                     evidence to deduce the most probable sequence of events leading to Booth's demise. Roder pointed
                     out that the lack of bloating and skin slippage suggested Booth had not been in the creek for long.
                     Additionally, fixed lividity on Booth's back suggested he died on his back rather than his front,
                     despite being found face down. Fluid was not found in Booth's lungs. Rigor mortis was affecting
                     Booth's body on discovery, which should have dissipated within 24-36 hours from the time of death.
                     Finally, the drag marks found near Booth's body, and the position his feet were found in suggested
                     that the body had been dragged:

                     According to Forensic Pathologist, Dr. Cyril Wecht, the death of Booth was highly suspicious.
                     Having taken a look at the medical examiner's report, West noted that the external findings were
                     complicating factors, specifically the body being found in a state of rigor mortis:

                     There's no way in the world that rigor mortis remains fixed for fourteen and a half days. It's not

                     <br /><br />
                     It would be my opinion, based upon a reasonable degree of forensic scientific medical certainty,
                     that this case is highly suspicious of foul play.

                     The creek obviously works off of the Delaware River. His body would've floated down directly into

                     Minnesota. Chappuis responded that she would pick him up, so she got in her car and set out to find
                     him, telling him look for her headlights. Suddenly, Zamlen said "Oh, my gosh, Anna, where are you?
                     Help!" before the call cut out abruptly. Repeated calls to Zamlen's phone were left unanswered
                     until around 8:30 AM when his battery died.
                     <br /><br />
                     Police, family and friends took to searching for Zamlin, scouring the banks of the Mississippi
                     River and its surroundings. The University of Minnesota organised a thorough door-to-door search,
                     while helicopters looked from the sky, and water patrols hunted along the shoreline. The only piece
                     of supposed evidence found was a footprint leading away from the river, but whether it belonged to
                     Zamlin could not be determined. Around April 7, blood hounds were brought in to search the area,
                     with them stopping around the same spot several times, which was nowhere near the river.
                     <br /><br />
                     Witness reports were said to be varied, with several testimonies taken from people at the party on
                     the night Zamlen's disappearance occured yielding conflicting information, including what was said
                     on the phone call between Zamlen and Chappuis.
                     <br /><br />
                     On May 1, Zamlen's body was discovered in the Mississippi River by a worker of the Ford Motor Co.
                     power plant in St. Paul, who found the body whilst cleaning a water intake grate that catches
                     debris in the river. The area the body was found in had been searched previously.
                     <br /><br />
                     Due to the Minnesota Data Practices Act, detailed information on the condition of Zamlen's body and
                     what the coroner found have never been made public. Police determined that the death was a case of
                     an accidental drowning, with Zamlen having gotten too close to the river, slipping and subsequently
                     drowning.

                     On February 8, 2010, it was reported that police had released new information regarding the case to
                     the media. Amongst the information, was the revelation that Zamlen had supposedly been conflicted
                     over his sexual orientation, and had confessed to friends on the night of his disappearance that he
                     was thinking of killing himself.

                     Dissatisfied with the conclusion of the case, and believing the police were trying to assassinate

                     County Medical Examiner, Dr. Thomas Uncini, to perform a second autopsy of the body. He concluded
                     that Zamlen showed no physical signs of having fallen down the slopes and into the river:

                     A second toxicology report revealed the presence of GHB in Zamlen's system, though the body
                     produces GHB naturally, so it can't be determined whether Zamlen was drugged or not.

                     Jelani Brinson
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     A graduate of the Fourth Baptist Christian School in North Minneapolis, Jelani Brinson (24) was a
                     devoted Christian, planning to become a minister. He was a loving father, and was said to have
                     spoke of his intentions to marry often to his girlfriend, Dena Anderson.
                     <br /><br />
                     On April 17, 2009, Brinson would arrive at Mad Jack's Sports Cafe in Brooklyn Park to meet with
                     friends at around 7:30 PM. He met with a colleague from the Sprint store that he worked at, and
                     both of them set out for another Sprint store on Colorado Lane at 8:00 PM, where they talked with
                     two more work colleagues. At 8:30 PM, Brinson visited his younger brother at his home in Brooklyn
                     Park before returning home to play with his daughter. At around 9:00 PM, headed in the direction of
                     Victory Grill, to meet with his friends that had moved on from Mad Jack's Cafe, however, Brinson
                     was said to have never made it to Victory Grill, and instead wound up at a house party in Anoka,
                     arriving close to 10:00 PM. After answering a phone call, Brinson suddenly left the party, and when
                     friends went outside to look for him at 10:05 PM, he was nowhere to be seen.
                     <br /><br />
                     The search for Brinson began immediately, with friends from the party searching the area on foot
                     before getting in a car and continued their search, but only finding Brinson's car which was in a
                     parking lot near the Victory Grill. The following day at 2:00 PM, Brinson's family reported him as
                     missing to the authorities. Family and friends did a door-to-door search, asking neighbours if they
                     had seen Brinson, while the friends who had searched the previous night retraced their path,
                     finally discovering Brinson's hat and shoe behind a wooden fence to the south of the neighbours'
                     homes. On April 19th, The search continued, with search and rescue teams bringing in K9 units.
                     Brinson's girlfriend searched from the train tracks where his hat and shoe had been found, down to
                     the Mississippi River nearby. Brinson's second shoe was recovered not too far from his other
                     personal effects, on the property of the Bolduc Company. On April 20, authorities began searching
                     along the Mississippi River.
                     <br /><br />
                     It wasn't until April 25, the body of Brinson was discovered by an employee of Green Haven Golf
                     Course, who spotted something floating in a pond on the west side of the clubhouse. Brinson's body
                     was found floating on his back in 2 to 3 feet of water, with his right hand sticking up out of the
                     pond. Brinson still had his wallet on his person which ruled out a mugging. Strangely, Brinson's
                     socks were clean, suggesting he was placed in the pond, as he was missing his shoes, and would've
                     had at least some grass or mud on them if he walked into the pond. The body was found in a state of
                     rigor, suggesting that Brinson had only been dead a short time.
                     <br /><br />
                     According to the medical examiner, Brinson's death took place before he was placed in the pond. The
                     body was absent any physical injuries or marks, no alcohol or drugs were found in his system, and
                     anatomical issues, as well as drowning were all ruled out. The toxicology report showed that
                     Brinson had not consumed any alcohol, but he had a high enough level of GHB in his system to be
                     considered not to have complete control of has faculties:

                     easily directed to where others wanted him to go.

                     Investigating the case further, Gannon and Gilbertson pointed out in their 2014 book
                     <i>Case Studies in Drowning Forensics</i> that it was suspicious that Brinson's shoes and hat found
                     during the search created a path leading from the house party to the golf course pond, yet K9 units
                     couldn't pick up a single scent of Brinson from them. Additionally, the fact Brinson had clean
                     socks proved that it was unlikely that Brinson walked into the pond himself, and even less
                     likely that he spent the entire time he was missing walking around in his socks.

                     get to the middle of the pond without soiling the bottoms of his socks was for him to be carried

                     Brinson at the party, or he fled and was pursued. He was then kept somewhere for a period of time
                     before being killed and dumped in the pond, with his shoes and hat being placed later to suggest
                     that Brinson had walked to the golf course of his own volition before drowning in the pond.

                     Described by friends as a good student and social individual, Gerald Smith (22) was a senior at
                     Indiana State University, who was known to have a love for both computer software and hardware.
                     <br /><br />
                     On April 30, 2009, Smith, along with a group of classmates and faculty, were out celebrating the
                     completion of a business project at the Ballyhoo Tavern in Terre Haute, Indiana. At around 12:20 AM
                     on May 1, Smith was said to have been escorted out of the front entrance by two men, supposedly for
                     having vomited in the bar. Once outside, Smith began to walk before being stopped by a student and

                     refused, stating that he was able to walk back. Smith was reported as missing later that evening.
                     <br /><br />
                     Once he was reported as missing, a number of volunteers and university officials scoured the area
                     of campus near where Smith was last seen. The following day, a larger swath of the university
                     grounds is searched in the evening. On May 3, the search area was increased, with the shores of the
                     Wabash River now included. Horseback officers from the Vigo County Sheriff's Department searched
                     the banks of the Wabash River unsuccessfully. K9 units were said to have picked up several scents
                     linked to Smith, including a scent leading from Ballyhoo Tavern all the way to 1st Street before
                     disappearing, as well as one leading to an apartment on Spruce Street. On May 4, the search
                     continued, with volunteers and university staff searching at around 3:00 PM. The search for Smith
                     was considered to have been incredibly thorough:

                  <p>
                     Witnesses at the Ballyhoo Tavern stated that Smith had been drinking heavily, something he wasn't
                     known to do often. Detective Denzil Lewis confirmed that he had been present and off-duty that
                     night, and had asked Smith to leave the bar, to which he politely cooperated. A number of further
                     witnesses came forward, including a Circle K clerk who mentioned having seen Smith between 1:00 and
                     1:30 AM when he tried to make a purchase, while her colleague had seen him the following day out by
                     the dumpsters, though CCTV footage revealed nothing. One witness claimed to see Smith staggering
                     around the intersection of Canal Street and North 2nd Street between 1:30 AM to 1:45 AM, where a
                     golden Toyota Camry, occupied by a woman and a man, stopped to speak to Smith for a few minutes
                     before leaving. Another witness, a bus driver, claimed that a man resembling Jerry, who was
                     accompanied by a similar aged man, had attempted to board her bus at around 2:30 AM but was
                     refused as she was off-duty. A final witness, a security officer, claimed to have seen a man
                     resembling Jerry walk into Union Hospital's Emergency Room lobby at 3:30 AM. The man had mentioned
                     that he had walked from Ballyhoo Tavern and was expecting his girlfriend to arrive via ambulance to
                     the emergency room, but left once a receptionist informed him that no ambulances were en route, and
                     the security officer had let him know that she may have been transported to Regional Hospital.
                     <br /><br />
                     On May 8, at around 7:00 PM, Smith's body was discovered by four local residents, floating in the
                     Wabash River. The body was found face down, and was 50 miles away from where Smith had been last
                     seen. Smith's body still had his phone on his person. A toxicology report showed that Smith's blood
                     alcohol concentration was at 0.149, and GHB was found in his system. The autopsy report stated that
                     there was no signs of foul play, and the cause of death was accidental drowning.
                     <br /><br />
                     In their 2014 book, <i>Case Studies in Drowning Forensics</i>, Gannon and Gilbertson reveal more
                     details about the case while doing their own further investigations.
                     <br /><br />
                     The apartment that the K9 traced Smith's scent to belonged to a man who was in a relationship with
                     a woman that Smith had interacted with at the Ballyhoo Tavern on the night of his disappearance.
                     During the night, Smith had reportedly put his arm around the woman's shoulders, prompting her
                     boyfriend to become jealous and verbally confront Smith. The man then left Ballyhoo Tavern with
                     three friends. Despite the woman claiming her boyfriend wouldn't hurt Smith physically, she also
                     reported to police that he had mentioned committing suicide shortly after Smith's disappearance.
                     <br /><br />
                     Upon investigating Ballyhoo Tavern to obtain CCTV footage, authorities found that the footage on
                     the night Smith went missing had a recording gap lasting from 12:00 AM to 1:00 AM, the exact time
                     Smith would have been escorted out of the tavern.
                     <br /><br />
                     Cell phone records recovered from Smith's phone revealed some puzzling facts, showing that between
                     the hours of 9:00 PM and 10:00 PM on April 30, Smith's phone was not with him in Ballyhoo Tavern. A
                     photograph was found to have been taken on the phone at 9:51 PM, with the coordinates showing it
                     was taken over a mile away by foot. There was no mention of Smith leaving the bar and returning, so
                     whether he took the photo or someone else did and returned the phone to him is unknown.

                  A number of errors made in the autopsy report were highlighted by Gannon and Gilbertson, such as it
                  stating that Smith's ears were not pierced, when they clearly were. Smith was also reported as
                  wearing loafer shoes, when he was in fact wearing ankle-high boots. No ocular changes were described
                  in the report, an odd omission in an autopsy. Smith's body was found with a ballpoint pen on his
                  person, though his parents received a pencil in his personal effects instead. And finally, a witness
                  reported giving Smith a cigarette on the night of his disappearance at around 11:45 PM, but no
                  nicotine or cotinine was reported in the toxicology report. Following up with his own test, Gilbertson
                  found that Smith had a higher nicotine level than cotinine, heavily suggesting that unless he died
                  shortly after smoking, Smith had to have been alive for some time for the nicotine and cotinine to
                  have left his system:

                  <blockquote class="quote mx-6 text-justify">
                     The only way for him to have the nicotine and cotinine values that he did was to have died before
                     the nicotine peaked in his blood and any cotinine appeared. In other words, Jerry would have
                     had to have died within 1/2 hour of beginning to smoke the cigarette. But, nearly an hour had
                     already passed between when he smoked the cigarette (23:45 hours) and when he left the bar
                     (00:40 hours). Since residual cotinine would have remained in his blood from the cigarette
                     he had smoked in the Ballyhoo Tavern, this meant that the cotinine in Jerry's bloodstream
                     from the night he disappeared had to entirely clear his system and then the process restarted.

                     Gannon and Gilbertson concluded that Smith was likely kidnapped, plied with alcohol and GBL while
                     being held for some time, and given a final cigarette before being killed by asphyxia or hypoxia
                     before being placed in the river.

                     William Hurley
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     Described as funny, spontaneous and genuine, William Hurley (24) was a Navy veteran who liked to
                     draw and had aspirations to be a landscape architect.
                     <br /><br />
                     On October 8, 2009, Hurley and some friends attended a Bruins hockey game at the TD Garden in
                     Boston, Massachusetts. During the game, Hurley had texted his girlfriend, Claire LeBeau, several
                     times, frustrated about someone who was sitting with them. Midway through the game, Hurley
                     announced to his friends that he wanted to leave, and asked his LeBeau to come pick him up.
                     Hurley was caught on security camera footage leaving the arena. LeBeau left Dorchester to pick him
                     up, calling him as she approached the front of the arena to coordinate with one another. While on
                     the phone, Hurley seemed lost and told LeBeau that his cell phone battery was about to die, she
                     told him to ask someone where he was and overheard a voice inform Hurley that he was at "99 Nashua
                     Street" before the phone abruptly cut out. Upon her arrival to Nashua Street, LeBeau was unable
                     to find Hurley, and after unsuccessfully trying to get his attention by yelling his name, she
                     reluctantly returned home.
                     <br /><br />
                     The following morning, LeBeau attempted to report Hurley as missing with the police after she
                     still had not heard from him, but she had to wait 24 hours before she could file an official
                     report. LeBeau contacted Hurley's family who all set out to Boston to look for him themselves,
                     putting up missing posters around the waterfront. Eventually, the police got involved, and on
                     October 11, his cell phone was found, broken, near 99 Nashua Street. Police were stated to have
                     done a thorough search of the Charles River on October 13, but found no signs of Hurley. Police
                     were so confident that Hurley was not in the river that they contacted LeBeau, confirming that
                     Hurley is not in the river and they will continue to search for him.
                     <br /><br />
                     On October 14, a police officer on a routine walk discovered Hurley's body floating around 30
                     feet offshore of the Charles River.
                     <br /><br />
                     The autopsy report revealed that Hurley had suffered blunt force trauma to the eye, while the
                     toxicology report came back as positive, showing he had abnormally high levels of GHB in his
                     system, with only traces of alcohol. Hurley's cause of death was concluded as an accidental
                     drowning, though the manner of death was left undetermined. The police determined that Hurley had
                     been intoxicated, stumbled and fell into the river (causing his eye wound), and drowned.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 2015, retired Boston Police Officer, Joe Fisher, did some research in the area due to the
                     influx of drowning cases. He went on to discover the graffiti of a smiley face with three stars,
                     found near the Boston Harbor, as well as another smiley face found in a park near 99 Nashua:

                     analyst took a close look into Hurley's broken cell phone, who claimed that the damage looked
                     more like human intervention than an accident caused by a car, as the police reported:

                     Jay Polhill
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     A charismatic and popular student, Jay Polhill (20) was a photography major at Columbia College in
                     Chicago. Popular on campus, Polhill made many friends turing his time in college, and excelled in
                     his studies.
                     <br /><br />
                     On February 28, 2010, Polhill was supposed to show up at a party but never made it. Earlier that
                     day at 10:00 AM, he had responded to a message from his mother, letting her know that he had a busy
                     night and that he'd be in touch later. Polhill's girlfriend had also communicated with him, telling
                     him that she would see him in his dorm after he was done with the party.
                     <br /><br />
                     On March 2, Polhill's body was discovered in the Calumet River by someone collecting water samples.
                     His location was near an industrial area close to 126th Street and South Stony Island in South
                     Chicago, 20 miles away from the Columbia College campus. The body was found naked from the waist
                     down, with the only item of clothing on him being a t-shirt.
                     <br /><br />
                     The coroner's report revealed that there was no sign of sexual assault, though the head had
                     sustained fractures on both sides of the skull, as well as a broken kneck. Both of his legs had
                     identical laceration marks on them. A toxicology report showed that Polhill had no alcohol or drugs
                     in his system. The coroner's report came back as inconclusive.
                     <br /><br />
                     Polhill's family hired a private investigator, who assisted them in getting Medical Examiner, Dr.
                     Mitra Kalelkar, to take another look at their son's case. On October 10, after consulting
                     colleagues, the findings were amended, with the method of death due to injuries to the head, and
                     cause of death as drowning, though police still did not rule the death as a homicide.
                     <br /><br />
                     Investigators retrieved video surveillance of Polhill leaving his dorm on February 28, heading to
                     the 500 block of South State Street. He was noted as wearing winter clothes, and carrying a laptop
                     bag as well as his camera. These items, as well as any other personal effects and clothes have
                     never been recovered. His friends believed that the missing items point to a robbery turned
                     violent, as noted by Taylor Streiff, a friend of Polhill's:

                     Speaking to his friends, investigators found out that Polhill was working on a photography project
                     based on bridges, with the Calumet River being a prime location for such a project. This was
                     affirmed by Polhill's Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) card, which showed that he had taken the Red
                     Line to the river.
                     <br /><br />
                     In May 2011, an article written by Pam Zekman for CBS Chicago queried whether the case was not
                     ruled as a homicide in an effort to keep the homicide rate down in Chicago. Chief of Detectives for
                     the Chicago Police Department, Thomas Byrne struck back at the suggestion, and confirmed that their
                     cold case unit was looking into it:

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     A four-year varsity letterman in wrestling during his years in Chartiers Valley High School, James
                     "Jimmy" Slack (25) was said to love travelling and spending time outdoors, and was taking time off
                     working on a barge.
                     <br /><br />
                     On December 6, 2011, Slack along with a friend, Paulette Beadling, attended a String Cheese
                     Incident concert at Stage AE in the North Side of Pittsburgh. The pair were dropped off at the
                     concert by a mutual friend. At around 9:30 PM, Beadling went to the concession stand to get a
                     drink, and upon returning, Slack was gone. Sometime close to 10:00 PM, Slack took a picture with an
                     unidentified woman. At 1:00 AM, December 7, Beadling called Slack's cell phone, and the two spoke
                     briefly and for the next hour, swapped text messages. Beadling mentioned that she had found someone
                     to take her home from the concert, so she gave Slack her address, as well as a phone number for a
                     taxi service. At 3:00 AM, Slack told Beadling that he was planning on walking home, that he was out
                     partying, but he didn't know where he was.
                     <br /><br />
                     Later that day, Slack's family contacted the authorities after he had failed to answer any phone
                     calls and failed to show up at his niece's birthday party. The investigation included a thorough
                     search, with flyers being plastered around Pittsburgh. Local hospitals, jails and medical examiners
                     were searched by police but to no avail. The family posted a $5,000 reward for any information on
                     Slack. On December 22, a candlelight vigil was held at Bethan Presbyterian Church in support of
                     Slack. On December 31, Slack's family contacted the Psychic Vincent Sisters to take a look into the
                     case and see if they could retrace Slack's footsteps. The sisters believed that Slack would be
                     found in the Ohio River.
                     <br /><br />
                     Upon being questioned, the woman that Slack had taken a picture with reported that she had seen
                     Slack in the smoking section outside of Stage AE, but had not seen him again. Beadling stated that
                     she believed, based on her conversations with Slack via telephone, that he was quite intoxicated.
                     <br /><br />
                     On January 23, 2012, Slack's body was found by the crew of a River Quest tour boat on the shore of
                     the Ohio River, a short distance from the Carnegie Science Center. Slack's wallet, phone and cash
                     were all found on his body. Authorities concluded that the cause of death was accidental drowning,
                     but the manner of death was undetermined.

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     An adventurous man with a kind heart, Nick Wilcox (24) was a political-science major at the
                     University of Wisconsin.
                     <br /><br />
                     On December 31, 2013, Wilcox was out celebrating New Year's Eve at the Irish Rec Room: an infamous
                     bar on North Old World Third Street in downtown Milwaukee.
                     <br /><br />
                     Some time between 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM on January 1, Wilcox was physically removed from the bar,
                     with security hauling him out onto the street after stepping in between a physical altercation
                     involving two other patrons. He would last be seen walking down an alley not far from the club.
                     According to his girlfriend, Kelly McGonagil, Wilcox's phone would go dead shortly after he was
                     ejected from the bar, and after an hour had passed, she asked the bouncers where her boyfriend had
                     gone. According to security, Wilcox had "left with a guy wearing a red shirt".
                     <br /><br />
                     Wilcox's parents were soon told of his disappearance, and they spent the rest of New Year's Day
                     searching for him. By January 6, a large number of people were assisting in the search for Wilcox,
                     with the east side of Milwaukee being combed by several parties, including Alterra on the Lake,
                     the Oak Leaf Trail, and North Avenue.
                     <br /><br />
                     On March 28, Wilcox's body was discovered floating in the Milwaukee River by two police officers.
                     The body was near the 1000 block of N. Old World 3rd Street, some 350-500 feet (less than a block)
                     from where he was supposedly last seen.
                     <br /><br />
                     An autopsy report stated that Wilcox's body showed no signs of physical trauma, though it was
                     heavily decomposed. A toxicology report revealed that Wilcox had a blood alcohol concentration of
                     0.22. Wilcox's death was ultimately ruled as an accidental drowning.
                     <br /><br />
                     Wilcox's family refuse to believe his death was caused by accident:

                     Paul Kochu
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     A graduate from Pittsburgh's Duquesne University, Paul Kochu (22) worked as an ICU nurse at
                     Allegheny General Hospital.
                     <br /><br />
                     On December 15, 2014, Kochu and his two roommates left for the evening to Smoking Joe's on the
                     south Side of Pittsburgh to drink and watch a game of Monday Night Football. Kochu was the first to
                     leave the bar, and later that evening, Kochu had gone missing from their apartment. When Kochu
                     didn't come home on December 16, the roommates got in touch with Kochu's family, who then went to
                     Pittsburgh to look for him.
                     <br /><br />
                     Authorities suggested that Kochu may have been staying with a friend, and told his family to wait
                     to see if he would show up later. A number of volunteers searched the area surrounding Kochu's
                     apartment. Police investigated Kochu's bank statements and call history, but found that he had not
                     made any transactions or calls. A CCTV camera caught Kochu walking down a street towards the 10th
                     Street Bridge at 2:45 AM, with the footage showing that he was walking strangely, as if intoxicated
                     or hurt. K9 units were brought in, but they were unable trace any scent of Kochu.
                     <br /><br />
                     According to Kochu's roommates, Kochu had left Smoking Joe's first. At around 1:30 AM, Kochu called
                     one of his roommates to tell them that he had cut himself and was bleeding, asking them for
                     assistance. The roommates left to help Kochu back at their apartment to stop the bleeding. When
                     they got to the apartment, a confrontation flared up between Kochu and the roommates, with Kochu
                     falling into the wall and hurting himself. On trying to help Kochu, he became emotional, shifting
                     from being combative to upset. The roommates left to go get food, leaving Kochu alone. CCTV footage
                     caught the roommates at a McDonalds Drive-Thru around 2:20 AM, with another camera catching them
                     arriving back at the apartment at 2:30 AM. On their arrival at the apartment, Kochu was gone, along
                     with his keys, phone and wallet.
                     <br /><br />
                     On March 20, 2015, Kochu's body was found, naked and floating face-down in the Ohio River, near
                     Wheeling, West Virginia. The coroner found that Kochu had a minor cut on his hand, three broken
                     ribs, and a wound on his scalp. The toxicology report stated that Kochu's blood alchohol
                     concentration level was 0.15. Authorities deemed Kochu's death an accidental drowning, but the
                     manner of his death remained undetermined.
                     <br /><br />
                     Kochu's roommates went on to take polygraph tests, with one passing and the other being found as
                     inconclusive.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 2016, Kochu's father stated to the Daily Local News in Pennsylvania that Kochu's family did not
                     agree with the police's conclusion, and believed he had fallen victim to foul play:

                     Dakota James
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     Described as a "smart" and "outgoing" man, Dakota James (23) was a carrier sales coordinator
                     at J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. who had graduated from Duquesne University.
                     <br /><br />
                     On the night of December 15th, 2016, James had gone out drinking with coworkers, but remembered
                     nothing from that point on. Disoriented and wandering the streets of downtown Pittsburgh, James
                     resorted to calling his friend Shelley for help, stating that he was cold, lost and needed
                     help. Shelley got into her car and left to help James, who told her he was in Pittsburgh's
                     North Side. Shelley used her GPS to track James' location, which was pinpointing him on the
                     opposite end of town, at the Springhill Suites on Water Street in Pittsburgh's South Side. On
                     asking James if he was there, he sent her a photo of a jean-covered leg and responded with
                     confusion, stating that he was cold, he needed help, and the police wouldn't help him. 10 minutes
                     later, Shelley pulled up to the Springhill Suites, where she noticed a dark SUV facing the wrong
                     direction outside of the hotel. James emerged from the hotel and started walking towards the SUV.
                     After Shelley yelled his name, James turned in her direction, walked to her car, and got in.
                     <br /><br />
                     Shivering and crying, James was reluctant to speak about what happened that night, only mentioning
                     that he recalled leaving his work Christmas party to go to some bars with work colleagues. The only
                     thing he remembered after that is finding himself walking on the street with no memory of how he
                     got there. He mentioned that he had approached a police officer who wouldn't help, leading to him
                     calling Shelley. Though his clothes were wet and disheveled, Shelley noticed that James wasn't
                     slurring his words, and he had walked to her car in a straight line, indicating that he wasn't
                     drunk. She offered to take him to the hospital, but at his insistence, she took him home. James
                     thanked Shelley the next day, only mentioning that he had a hangover and telling Shelley to forget
                     the incident.
                     <br /><br />
                     On January 25, 2017, James disappeared after a similar night of drinking with friends. He was
                     caught on surveillance camera at 11:49 PM in Downtown Pittsburgh, walking through Katz Plaza and
                     down an alley toward Fort Duquesne Boulevard.
                     <br /><br />
                     James was discovered on April 6, when his lifeless body was found floating face up in the Ohio
                     River, 10 miles from where he was last seen. Graffiti of an upside-down smiley face was found
                     beneath the I-79 Bridge, upstream from where James' body was found.
                     <br /><br />
                     The autopsy report stated that James' body had undergone moderate decomposition, and that there was
                     no evidence of recent physical violence or trauma. The police did not release any photo evidence of
                     the scene, and deduced that James had fallen into the river near the Roberto Clemente Bridge in the
                     city center on the night he went missing.

                     From the autopsy report that the family sent me, there's very little injuries to the body, and he
                     supposedly travelled ten miles over a dam, which he should have incurred, even post-mortem.
                     <br /><br />
                     The autopsy report states, only moderate decomposition. After fourty days in the water, Dakota's
                     body should have had extensive decomposition.

                     Private Investigator, Larry Forletta, retraced James' footsteps from the night of his

                     footage of James that night, suggesting that it wasn't where James entered the water.

                     Speaking to members of Robinson Township Swift Water Rescue, who recovered James' body, and the
                     Army Corps of Engineers that operate the dam, it was very unlikely that James' body would be as
                     pristine as it was, if it had passed through the dam. Lock records released regarding the dam
                     showed that on the day James would have passed through, the gates were not open wide enough for a
                     body to pass without getting damaged, though if James' body passed through earlier, it
                     would have been possible to pass through unharmed:

                  <blockquote class="quote mx-6 text-justify">
                     The total opening of all fourteen gates was twenty-five and a half feet.
                     <br /><br />
                     If [James] were to have gone through the dam, it's quite plausible that he would've been beat up
                     like crazy, because the openings would have been small.
                     <br /><br />
                     I know on March first, for example, they had number one gate open seven and a half feet...
                     <br /><br />
                     You have an opening that's seven and a half foot wide... Could he float
                     through that dam and not touch any of the sides? I say yes.

                     The James' family were finally able to acquire the official police and autopsy reports, as well
                     as recovery photographs. The findings showed marks on James' neck and fingers that had been left
                     out of the autopsy report. Taking a look at the photos, Forensic Pathologist, Dr. Cyril Wecht,
                     highlighted evidence that insinuated human intervention was a likely cause of death:

                     <br /><br />
                     I notice a distinct difference in the colouration of the fingernail beds, of the fourth and fifth
                     fingers on both the right and left hands, and they certainly would be consistent with someone
                     reaching up and trying to release the pressure from a ligature that is being applied around their
                     neck.

                     There is a time order problem where we don't know when the smiley face was painted. It could have
                     been painted years prior to when the body entered the water. In addition, the smiley faces are all
                     different. No two smiley faces ever matched.
