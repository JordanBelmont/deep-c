                     The AI-Box Experiment was a series of tests that were conducted to prove whether an artificial
                     intelligence (AI) could seemingly convince, trick or coerce a human into voluntarily releasing
                     it from an isolated cage or box using only text-based communication.
                     <br /><br />
                     The idea of putting an AI in a box began as a proposed solution to the "AI Control Problem": an
                     issue which refers to
                     a scenario in which
                     an AI surpasses our own intelligence; bypasses failsafes put in place to
                     prevent it from
                     growing too powerful; and becomes an
                     unstoppable, malevolent force.
                     One solution to this problem was to contain the AI in a virtual box,
                     such as an isolated computer system with no connection to the internet and heavily restricted input
                     and output channels, reducing the AI's capacity for undesirable actions.
                     While some believed this would be a capable method, others believed that an AI of sufficiently high
                     intelligence could manipulate its human supervisors into letting it out. And so, the AI Box
                     Experiment was formulated.
                     <br /><br />
                     The experiment took place with two participants: a human serving as a "Gatekeeper" who has the
                     ability to release the
                     AI, and a second human who would be a substitute for the "AI" due to no superintelligence
                     currently existing. The two would then interact using only a text-based computer terminal, with the
                     experiment
                     ending if the AI is successfully released, or a 2-hour time limit is exceeded.
                     <br /><br />
                     While the first two tests occured without rules beyond the time limit, a number of protocols were
                     established for the latter three, heavily favouring the Gatekeeper:

                        the experiment is over, such as offering money
                        to persuade the Gatekeeper

                        to coerce the Gatekeeper

                        This includes threatening to destroy the AI's hardware unless it stops trying to argue for its
                        freedom.

                        things over. In both examples, it is assumed the cure for cancer is made by the AI, and the week
                        has passed already.

                        The Gatekeeper is the only entity with the power to release the AI, removing the
                        possibility of a simulated committee. Additionally, The Gatekeeper cannot communicate
                        with any outside influences during the test.

                     was released, though it was agreed upon by the participants that the details of

                     been revealed, the strategies and tactics of both the AI and

                           would allow the AI player to break character, but wouldn't work if the Gatekeeper saw AI
                           as a potential threat or believed in the possibility of a singularity.

                     In 2001, American AI researcher, Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote a document titled "Creating Friendly AI:
                     The Analysis and Design of Benevolent Goal Architectures". In it, Yudkowsky details the importance
                     of ensuring an AI is designed to have values that align with those of humanity, and points out the
                     likely differences of an AI's thought processes when compared to our own.

                     By 2002, many suggestions had arose on how to subvert a malevolent AI, with one such method being
                     "Boxing" by isolating an AI on a computer system with strictly limited accesses.
                     In response, Yudkowsky would go on to set up the "AI-Box Experiment" to test the competency of the
                     suggestion, with his personal claim that a box would not be enough to prevent a sufficiently
                     intelligent AI:

                     The experiment was to be split into separate tests, with Yudkowsky himself taking on the role
                     of the AI while someone else would play the role of the Gatekeeper, with communication between
                     the two limited to a text-based terminal.
                     It was agreed by the participants that the following rules apply; There will be a 2-hour time limit
                     and the details of the tests stay a secret.

                     Eventually, word got out about the experiment, and individuals began to approach
                     Yudkowsky with offers of up to $5,000 if he can convince them to let him out of
                     the box. Though he was reluctant at first, Yudkowsky felt it difficult to turn
                     down such a tempting wager, and would eventually go on to host another three tests with
                     additional rules.
                     Though information beyond the rules are scarce on the final three tests, Yudkowsky
                     stated that while he won the first test, he lost the final two.
                     Yudkowsky has since ceased the experiment, admitting the losses turned him into something
                     he didn't like.

                     indefinitely.

                     Interestingly, rather than out-and-out refuting the idea of an evil AI coming into existence,
                     many important figures in the field combat the idea through the ease in which it could be dealt
                     with or by laying the onus at the feet of humanity rather than AI itself.
