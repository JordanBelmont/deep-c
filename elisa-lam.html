                     Elisa Lam was a Canadian tourist visiting the United States in 2013. Lam was last seen alive on
                     January 31, and on February 19, 2013, her lifeless body was discovered in a cistern on the roof of
                     the Cecil Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. The manner of Lam's death was reported as inconclusive,
                     and her death was ultimately ruled as an accidental drowning.
                     <br /><br />
                     Footage of Lam was released by the Los Angeles Police Department, showing her acting erratically
                     in the hotel's elevator, which subsequently led to a large amount of online interest in the case,
                     with internet sleuth's dissecting the footage to piece together the events leading to Lam's death.
                     <br /><br />
                     Inconsistencies in the case as well as a number of strange coincidences helped catapult the case
                     into an infamous, worldwide internet mystery.
                     <br /><br />
                     Lam's body would eventually be discovered, having drowned in the water tank on the roof of The
                     Cecil Hotel.

                     In January 2012, Lam highlighted her distress over a potential "relapse". Her struggles caused Lam
                     to drop a number of school classes, and she worried that this would prevent her from attending
                     graduate school:

                     I'm very disappointed in myself for breaking down during the term forcing me to withdraw from

                     means I've been a first year for three years and this September it will be for the fourth year
                     because I require 30 credits in order for second year status.

                     On June 21, LA County coroner's report determined that there were no visible signs of trauma, and
                     drugs were not in Lam's system, aside from traces of her prescription medication. Lam's body was
                     reported as being naked on discovery, floating face-up. Her watch and room-key were in the tank
                     with her, while her clothes were found floating in the water, covered in a layer of "sand-like
                     particulate". The final consensus is "accidental drowning" with her bipolar disorder as a
                     "contributing factor".

                     On September 19, the parents of Elisa Lam, David and Yinna Lam, filed a wrongful death lawsuit
                     against Cecil Hotel Management Inc., citing that their daughter's death could have been prevented

                     Elisa Lam was a 22-year old Canadian student of Chinese descent. She was diagnosed with bipolar
                     disorder and depression, though her parents stated she had no suicidal tendencies. Lam's medicinal
                     regiment for her condition included Wellbutrin, quetiapine, lamotrigine, venlafaxine, and Dexedrine
                     Spansule, though she was known to have not taken her medications on several occassions, causing her
                     to suffer hallucinations and become hospitalised more than once.
                     <br /><br />
                     Lam's blog revealed much of her personality and thoughts: she had a passion for the fashion world,
                     and liked to document her travels in photo format, but was also worried about how her disorder may
                     affect her future, and spoke openly about dealing with mental illness and loneliness.

                     The Cecil Hotel was built in 1924 as a cheap, affordable hotel. The hotel consists of 14 floors and
                     700 total guest rooms.
                     A part of the hotel was rebranded in 2011 as "Stay on Main". Incidentally, this was the name of the
                     hotel Elisa Lam booked online and checked into, not the Cecil Hotel.
                     <br /><br />
                     The hotel has a history of misfortune, with numerous suicides, murders, and illicit activity taking
                     place within its walls. It is located near Downtown's Skid Row, a notorious hotspot
                     for crime and rampant homelessness.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1964, a long-term resident of the hotel, named "Pigeon Goldie" Osgood was found dead in her
                     room, having been raped, beaten and stabbed. Her murder remains unsolved.
                     The hotel was a temporary residence for several serial killers, most famously Richard "The Night
                     Stalker" Ramirez during the 1980s, and Jack Unterweger in 1991. The hotel is also purportedly the
                     last place Elizabeth Short "The Black Dahlia" was seen before her death.

                     Lam is seen entering an elevator at the Cecil Hotel where upon she begins to press buttons for
                     several different floors of the hotel. Lam is seen standing and waiting with the elevator door
                     remaining open. After a few seconds, Lam quickly peers outside of the elevator, looking in both
                     directions before pushing herself up against the wall of the elevator, moving into the corner
                     closest to the door, seemingly hiding from someone. After a few more seconds, Lam slowly peers
                     around the corner of the elevator door again, before suddenly stepping out of it as if to catch
                     someone in the corridor. Lam then proceeds to take a few steps in front of the elevator before
                     entering it shortly and then leaving to stand at the left side of the elevator entrance.

                     buttons to different floors once more. Without waiting for the elevator to react, Lam steps out
                     into the corridor again, returning to the same spot at the side of the elevator entrance. Lam then
                     turns to face the right side of the corridor and can be seen gesturing, and wringing her hands in a
                     strange manner. Lam eventually leaves down the corridor to the left. The elevator doors close after
                     30 more seconds.

                     After close inspection, many online argued that the footage released to the public of Lam in the

                     The footage shows the door to the elevator staying open for a lengthy period of time. Many wondered
                     if someone outside of the elevator may have been pushing the button to prevent the door from
                     closing, but a mixture of online and in-person investigations revealed that Lam had in fact pushed
                     the door hold button, either intentionally or accidentally.

                     At around the 2:25 mark of the video footage, Lam leaves from the front of the elevator a final
                     time, disappearing down the corridor before the elevator door closes. As Lam steps away from the
                     front of the elevator, what seems to be a foot, possibly belonging to someone else, can be seen for
                     a brief moment.

                     Lam could, in theory, have made her way to the roof via the fire escape, and could
                     accidentally have fallen into one of the water tanks, or have gotten in with the intention of being
                     able to get back out, but due to the distance of the lid, may have died in the tank.
                     <br /><br />
                     Upon discovery, Lam's body was naked, with her clothes found in the tank.

                     The likelihood of Lam removing her clothes herself before accidentally ending up in the tank only
                     for the clothes to end up in the tank too is a sticking point for those who believe she met with

                     A somber theory suggests that Lam knew what she was doing and intentionally ended her
                     own life. Having been shown to be able to access the roof herself via the fire escape ladder,
                     it's thought she made her way up to the roof and threw herself into the tank. Her blogs give
                     insight into Lam's struggles with her mental health, and so some believe Lam simply made the
                     decision herself, or failing to take her medications, felt compelled to do it:

                     was leaving a trail of his murder for people to discover and follow.

                     <br /><br />
                     Those who lean towards it being a member of hotel staff suggest that someone in charge may have
                     been able to control the elevator and intentionally kept Lam on the 14th floor, though this has
                     been mostly debunked after investigations revealed that Lam likely pushed the door hold button
                     herself.

                     The tank in which Lam's body was discovered would have been incredibly difficult to get to,
                     considering the stairs and access doors to the roof were all locked and alarmed, only accessible
                     by hotel staff.

                     Those who believe Lam may have been murdered by a resident or guest of the Cecil Hotel focus on
                     Lam's actions in the elevator. Many who have watched the elevator footage believe that Lam looked
                     as if she was hiding in the elevator from someone in the corridor. This is reinforced by Lam
                     peeking around the corner, suggesting someone is most likely present, but out of frame. Lam's hand
                     gestures while stood outside the elevator suggest she may have been communicating with someone
                     nearby

                     didn't inspect the water tanks, the police falsely reporting that the lid to the water tank was
                     found closed, and despite requests, a police report has never been provided.

                     It was noted that, for a while, when using Google Maps to view the Cecil Hotel it showed as a
                     company named "The Invisible Light Agency": essentially a top-secret company specialising in
                     producing lighting effects. Anthony Bea, a man reported to have been working for ILA, was
                     said to have moved on to work for The Raytheon Company, a military contractor and weapons
                     development company with plenty of controversy in their history.

                     The footage of Lam in the elevator shows her pushing a number of buttons to different floors,
                     and while some believe the buttons she pushes are random, there are those who believe the order
                     in which she pushed the buttons was intentional. The order is believed to be 14-10-7-4-Door Hold,
                     numbers that theorists have linked to verses in the Bible, specifically to The Book of John. Verses
                     4:7, 4:10, 4:14 all heavily reference water, which people believe is proof that Lam was possessed
                     by something to make her act odd in the elevator, push the buttons in that way, and then kill
                     herself.

                     Viewers of the tapes have claimed they can see the faint visage of serial killer Richard
                     Ramirez show up in the elevator, believing the hotel is haunted by the ghost of it's previous guest
                     who is manipulating events in order to kill Lam. This theory loses steam when taken into
                     account that Ramirez was still alive and incarcerated at the time of Lam's death.

                     A popular theory around the time the footage was released was that Lam was performing "The

                     enter another realm by pressing the correct sequence of floor buttons in an elevator, but leads to
                     the death of those who do it incorrectly.

                     Some have linked Lam's death with the occult, particularly with occult leader Aleister
                     Crowley. Crowley was said to have stayed in London's Hotel Cecil in the 1800s where he wrote his
                     poem, <i>Jephthah</i>, about a man who sacrifices his daughter, Siela, whose name is an anagram of
                     Elisa.

                     Crowley purportedly also drew a picture of a strange creature he dubbed "Lam", a creature he
                     believed he had contacted that resembles a stereotypical "grey" alien.
