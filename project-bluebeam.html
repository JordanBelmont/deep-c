                     Project Blue Beam is the name of a theoretical operation planned by NASA and orchestrated by
                     global elites to stage a supernatural or extraterrestrial event with the goal of establishing a
                     totalitarian world government.
                     <br /><br />
                     The theory purports that satellites, holograms, drones and frequency-based technology will be used
                     to simulate an alien invasion or a biblical event, causing widescale panic and ushering in a
                     government to bring about order.
                     <br /><br />
                     While it currently stands as just a theory, there are those that believe it's only a matter of time
                     before it happens, while others believe it has already begun based on world events.

                     Marshall Chadwell, entitled "Unidentified Flying Objects (Flying Saucers)" was sent to the Director
                     of the CIA. In the document, Chadwell outlined the psychological apsects of world-wide UFO

                     In 1975, Screenwriter Gene Roddenberry wrote a screenplay for his TV show <i>Star Trek</i>. The
                     plot of the screenplay saw aliens sending religious figures to Earth via holograms in order to
                     spread their own religion to humanity and ultimately, conquer the planet. Roddenberry's screenplay
                     was rejected, but he published the story as a novel instead, entitled <i>The God-Thing</i>.

                     In 1989, Physicist Robert Lazar blew the whistle on his time working for the U.S. government,
                     reverse engineering an extraterrestrial spacecraft. According to Lazar, he was employed at "S-4",
                     a hidden black-site facility near Area 51 that housed nine extraterrestrial flying saucers. Lazar
                     has gone on to be derided by ufologists for providing no real evidence to his claims.

                     In September 1996, Monast's children, who were being homeschooled by Monast, were taken from him
                     and made wards of the state to give them a public education.
                     <br /><br />
                     On December 4, Monast was arrested for spreading misinformation, spending the night in jail. The
                     following day, he died of a heart attack at the age of 51. Some theorise that his death was brought

                     California. The aircraft appeared at 80,000 ft before descending rapidly and stopping at
                     20,000 ft where it hovered until it ascended completely out of sight. Fravor went on to describe
                     the aircraft as a "tic tac" based on its shape in infrared imaging.

                     Later that year, a city was witnessed floating in the sky above Chinese cities Foshan and Jiangxi.
                     Scientists claimed it was a rare phenomenon known as fata morgana: a mirage due to light bending

                     Much speculation surrounds the untimely death of Serge Monast, the progenitor of the Blue Beam
                     theory. Monast suffered a heart attack at the age of 51, one day after being arrested for

                     When it comes to the first phase of Blue Beam, the ability to manufacture earthquakes is an actual
                     possibility. It's believed that fracking, mining, wastewater disposal, carbon storage or
                     underground nuclear testing all put immense stress on the Earth's crust and can induce seismicity.
                     In 2008, an earthquake in Sichuan, China is thought to have been caused by the nearby Zipingpu Dam
                     due to the weight of the reservoir's water and proximity to a fault line, while according to
                     state seismologist Austin Holland, wastewater injection wells were found to be the epicenter of the
                     2011 Oklahoma earthquake,.

                     In 1946, the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in clay pots found in a cave near Qumran. The scrolls
                     include some of the earliest texts from the Hebrew Bible, fundamentally changing what was known at
                     the time of the origins of Judaism and Christianity.
                     It's not far-fetched to believe that modern discoveries of ancient relics couldn't have a similar
                     impact on the way humanity interprets religious doctrine. Other scholars and experts have spoken on
                     how The Bible may already be false due to the biases of its writers against historical findings,
                     suggesting that the discovery of further discoveries that have been selectively curated could

                     fiction once upon a time, but as technology quickly advances, it's becoming more and more likely
                     with each passing year. Drone technology has upgraded from simple reconnaissance capabilities to
                     more complex high-resolution imaging and coordination, courtesy of AI. 3D holograms have come a
                     long way since their inception, and like drones and AI, the technology is advancing rapidly. While
                     many feel that we are still some way off from being able to produce convincing 3D holograms, and
                     both virtual reality and augmented reality both have too many requirements to fool people, there's

                     heart attack.

                     As for Blue Beam itself, in order to cause targeted earthquakes as noted in the first phase of the
                     project, a large scale operation like fracking or mining would likely need to take place, with
                     heavy machinery, enough infrastructure, and a lot of man-power needed. The inability of subtlety is
                     more than enough evidence to disprove a targeted earthquake as an act of god.

                     Technology is rapidly advancing, though we're incredibly far from the point where drones and
                     holograms could replicate something truly convincing to fool the human senses. While a hologram of
                     Tupac performed at Coachella in 2012, it's merely just trickery often using projectors and
                     reflections.

                     Not only that, but to coordinate a convincing hologram show that would simultaneously appear across
                     the globe, take the form of the region's most glorified religious figure, and speak directly into
                     the minds of its viewers in their native language would be such an undertaking that it might as
                     well be science fiction, at least for now.

                     On the subject of UFOs, while it's true that there are many more sightings in the modern era, and
                     while many governments have acknowledged their existence, there is absolutely no evidence that they
                     are extraterrestrial in nature, and official documentation details how the U.S government believes
                     UAPs could be one of several things, but extrateerestrial is not listed as one of them:

                     Airborne Clutter: These objects include birds, balloons, recreational unmanned aerial vehicles
                     (UAV), or airborne debris like plastic bags that muddle a scene and affect an operator's ability to
                     identify true targets, such as enemy aircraft.

                     Natural Atmospheric Phenomena: Natural atmospheric phenomena includes ice crystals,
                     moisture, and thermal fluctuations that may register on some infrared and radar systems.
                     <br /><br />
                     USG or Industry Developmental Programs: Some UAP observations could be attributable to
                     developments and classified programs by U.S. entities. We were unable to confirm, however,
                     that these systems accounted for any of the UAP reports we collected.
                     <br /><br />
                     Foreign Adversary Systems: Some UAP may be technologies deployed by China, Russia,
                     another nation, or a non-governmental entity.
                     <br /><br />
                     Other: Although most of the UAP described in our dataset probably remain unidentified due to
                     limited data or challenges to collection processing or analysis, we may require additional
                     scientific knowledge to successfully collect on, analyze and characterize some of them. We
                     would group such objects in this category pending scientific advances that allowed us to better
                     understand them. The UAPTF intends to focus additional analysis on the small number of cases
                     where a UAP appeared to display unusual flight characteristics or signature management.
