                     The urban legend of Inunaki Village centers around a mysterious, cursed village hidden away among
                     the forests of the Fukuoka Prefecture of Kyūshū, Japan. The town's residents were said
                     to have undergone harsh scrutiny and persecution during the Edo period, and so the villagers
                     refused to accept the Constitution of Japan, forcing the government to isolate it and refusing to
                     govern or police it.
                     <br /><br />
                     There are a number of rumours as to why the village was cordoned off, such as it being the site of
                     a mass murder; a place where occult rituals were conducted; an abandoned leper colony; a place
                     ravaged by disease; or that the villagers isolated themselves, resulting in the population
                     devolving into violent, inbred cannibals. No matter the theory, the one constant is that the
                     government quarantined the village to separate it from the rest of Japan.

                     The original Inunaki Village, known as Inunakidani Village (Inunaki Valley Village), was
                     established in the Edo Period of 1691. In 1889, the village was merged with the nearby Yoshikawa
                     Village and other surrounding areas to eventually make the city of Miyawaka. The original site of
                     Inunaki Valley Village now lies beneath the waters of Inunaki Dam, with the population of the
                     village being relocated to Wakita.

                     <br /><br />
                     In 1988, a gang of five teenagers approached a factory worker, Koichi Umeyama in his car as he was
                     stopped near the tunnel. The teens asked to borrow Koichi's car, and when he refused, they dragged
                     him out of the car and attacked him. Koichi managed to escape temporarily, but was caught once
                     again.
                     <br /><br />
                     The teens tried to throw Koichi over the edge of the Kanda Port, but he clung on to a nearby fence.
                     Worried his body may float and be discovered, the teens decided to throw Koichi into the trunk of
                     his car before severely beating him with items they found in the car. The teens then stopped off at
                     a gas station to pick up some petrol before heading to the Inunaki Tunnel where they covered Koichi
                     in gasoline. Koichi suddenly screamed out, his fear ringing throughout the tunnel, shocking the
                     teens enough that he managed to escape them once again, running off into the forest.
                     <br /><br />
                     The teens called out to Koichi that they wouldn't hurt him anymore, and when he trusted them and
                     emerged from the forest, they once again attacked him, tying him up, stuffing ripped clothing in
                     his mouth, and beating him over the head with a rock before finally setting him alight. Screaming
                     out in anguish, Koichi stumbled to the front of the Inunaki Tunnel where he finally succumbed to
                     his wounds.
                     <br /><br />
                     Satisfied that Koichi was truly dead, the teens left for a bar in Fukuoka where they were heard
                     boasting about setting someone on fire.
                     <br /><br />
                     Koichi's body was discovered the next day, with the cause of death determined to be due to blood
                     loss.
                     <br /><br />
                     The teens were arrested shortly thereafter, and despite their appeal to reduce their sentences,
                     the judge claimed that "The cruelty displayed is unlike any other seen in similar cases". The teens
                     were ultimately given life sentences for the murder of Koichi Umeyama.

                     sickle. The letter then urged the television network to check the area out. This would seemingly be

                  The name "Inunaki" can translate as "Dog Cry", the origin of which can be linked to several local

                  <ol>
                     <li>
                        <p>
                           One story claims that no dog could safely cross the Inunaki Ridge due to its dangerous,
                           narrow paths, leaving any dog stuck howling for help.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           A similar story tells of a wolf attempting to traverse Inunaki Ridge. It eventually came
                           across a waterfall, but try as it might, it couldn't reach the top, leaving it sat howling
                           in sadness at the bottom of the falls.

                           A more sinister story involves a villager and his pet dog. It's said that the dog would bark
                           all day and night, until one day, the villager's mind snapped and he finally killed the dog.
                           Soon after, the villager and his entire family were murdered, as it was the dog's barking
                           that was keeping the killers away.

                        <p>
                           An alternate version of the story sees the villager hunting in the forest, and thinking his
                           dog's barking was scaring off the wild animals, he killed his dog, only to be met by a giant
                           snake the dog was trying to warn him of.

                  <p>The Inunaki Village can only be accessed via the Inunaki Tunnel: an old pass completed in 1949.
                     The construction of the tunnel was said to have been a treacherous one, with the tunnel's roof
                     collapsing and killing hundreds of workers. Stories have been told of screams being heard within

                     was engulfed by the waters of the dam.
                     <br /><br />
                     The dam is now rumoured to be a popular suicide spot and place for people to dump dead bodies.

                     on their way to the town of Hisayama. Abandoning their car near Inunaki Tunnel, the couple followed
                     a small path that led into the forest, in order to seek assistance. The couple eventually came
                     across what seemed to be an abandoned village with a handwritten sign at its entrance that read
                     "The Japanese constitution is not in effect past here". Continuing on into the village, the couple
                     would only find traditional, old houses littering the village, all empty apart from darkness and
                     silence.

                     The couple decided to leave the village and head back to their car, when a villager suddenly
                     emerged from one of the darkened houses to greet them both. Approaching the young couple, the
                     villager hacked at the man with a sickle he had been brandishing, slicing him from neck to navel.
                     The woman turned to flee in terror, but she was quickly apprehended and thrown with force into the
                     street, breaking her ribs from the impact. Left in agony on the floor, the woman crawled towards
                     one of the dark, abandoned houses, her pursuer looming over her. Before his sickle found its mark
                     on her, The woman saw beyond the darkness: corpses piled high inside and between each of the houses
                     as she realised the crazy, old man had silenced the entire village, and now, them too.

                     away as a sign to ward off visitors to the village.
