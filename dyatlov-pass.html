                     The Dyatlov Pass Incident saw the death of nine Soviet hikers as they ventured through the northern
                     Ural Mountain range between February 1 and 2, 1959. The hikers, mostly students from the Ural
                     Polytechnical Institute, collectively had an abundance of experience in hiking and were good
                     friends. They were led by Igor Dyatlov, for whom the mountain pass would later be named.
                     <br /><br />
                     Evidence suggests that after establishing a camp on the slopes of Kholat Syakhl (Dead Mountain),
                     the group experienced something that caused them to cut or tear their way out of their tent and
                     flee the scene while inadequately dressed for the snowy landscape.
                     <br /><br />
                     Upon discovery of the bodies, the Soviet authorities determined that most of the hikers had died
                     from hypothermia, while the others from physical trauma, concluding that the cause was a
                     "compelling natural force". In 2019, Russia reopened the investigation, stating their findings that
                     an avalanche forced the group to abandon their tent, with the survivors dying of hypothermia.
                     <br /><br />
                     Despite the official narrative, inconsistencies between statements and strange details in the
                     evidence collected further fuel the mystery surrounding the series of events that led to the
                     hikers' deaths.

                        His body was found face up in the snow, with light clothing and no shoes. There was blood on his
                        lips, and his hands showed injuries that are consistent with those that occur in a fist fight.
                        It is thought, based on the pose of his corpse that he was attempting to return to the
                        tent, but collapsed from exhaustion and died of hypothermia.

                        been burned. Due to the broken branches of the tree he was found under, it has been speculated

                     On February 27, rescuers discovered footprints leading from the campsite downhill to the woods.
                     Near the tree line, a pine tree was discovered with its lower branches snapped off,
                     suggesting that it had been climbed. Beneath the tree were the remains of a small, makeshift fire,
                     and the lifeless bodies of Doroshenko and Krivonischenko. Dyatlov's body was next to be found,
                     located further up the slope, with the body of Kolmogorova found slightly closer to the tent,
                     suggesting both were attempting to make their way back.

                     Dyatlov and Kolmogorova's. Of the discovered bodies, all but Dyatlov were found to have been moved
                     after their death, having been found face down despite dying on their backs.
                     Due to Doroshenko and
                     Krivonischenko being found barely clothed, it had been assumed that their clothes had been taken by

                     Though Russian authorities have released their findings on what they believe happened to the
                     Dyatlov expedition group, it can't be stated with absolute certainty what caused a group of
                     experienced hikers to abandon their tent and walk out into the snow with no supplies and barely any
                     clothing between them. Additional unexplained details to the story have led to a host of theories
                     as to what happened to the group at Dyatlov Pass:

                     Avalanche
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     The most widely accepted explanation to the story and the one agreed upon by Russian authorities
                     and investigators, is that the Dyatlov expedition group fell victim to an avalanche.
                     It was theorised that the hikers heard the rumbling of what they believed to be an avalanche. This
                     caused them to immediately cut their way out of the tent to quickly escape, leaving behind their
                     provisions and clothing.
                     <br /><br />
                     After the initial confusion had settled, the hikers marched downhill towards the
                     tree line for cover from the weather. After reaching the woods, Doroshenko and Krivonischenko who
                     were the least dressed of the group, would have started to suffer from hypothermia. They then
                     created a small fire, and to get a lay of the land, someone climbed a nearby tree to see what was
                     around or to find the tent. Three of the hikers decided to head back to their tent for supplies,
                     but would die en route, and Doroshenko and Krivonischenko would die shortly of hypothermia.
                     <br /><br />
                     The remaining members are speculated to have received their fatal injuries from the avalanche
                     itself, falling into the ravine they were found in, or snow and ice collapsing on them from above
                     while in the ravine.

                     This theory has been thrown into question for a number of reasons. The area of Kholat Syakhl that
                     the group found themselves in has not historically been prone to avalanches, with the 30-degree
                     angle of the mountain slope the hikers had made camp at being considered too shallow for an
                     avalanche to pose a threat. It is also believed that an avalanche would have fully covered the tent
                     and the footprints left by the group leading to the tree line.

                     The idea of the hikers outrunning an
                     avalanche while barefoot in heavy snow isn't very plausible, and the footprints that were
                     discovered showed that the group had calmly walked in single file along the path of the alleged
                     avalanche.

                     <i>Communications Earth & Environment</i> where they spoke of the likelihood that the Dyatlov
                     hikers may have experienced a delayed slab avalanche: a smaller avalanche where the upper layer of
                     snow shifts and rolls after a weaker concentration of snow beneath it gives way.

                     "falling wind" that picks up speed and force as it travels down a gradient, creating devastating
                     levels of pressure in a matter of seconds.

                     the least clothing of all the hikers, while three of the hikers would perish on their way back to
                     the tent.

                     The remaining members are speculated to have dug a small shelter in the snow, which subsequently
                     collapsed and crushed them, with the force only increasing the longer their bodies lay there,
                     accounting for the injuries.

                  <p>
                     A theory, posed by author, Donnie Eichar details in his book <i>Dead Mountain: The Untold True
                        Story of the Dyatlov Pass Incident</i> the possibility that the Dyatlov expedition group could
                     have been affected by infrasound produced by a Kármán vortex street due to the topography of Kholat
                     Syakhl and the harsh winds buffeting it. Because of its dome-like shape, the mountain could have
                     caused the strong winds to warp in to a series of vortices, producing ear-splitting sounds, but
                     also infrasound: a low-pitched sound that cannot be heard by humans, but has been known to induce
                     loss of sleep, shortness of breath, and irrational fear in those exposed to it.

                     groups. This explains some of the hikers dying from exposure, while others were injured from
                     falling into a ravine.

                     A number of factors contribute to the theory that a lightning strike or ball lightning caused the
                     deaths of the Dyatlov expedition group. Witnesses during that time period claimed seeing lights in
                     the sky above Kholat Syakhl the night of the incident, further corroborated by members of the local
                     Mansi tribe, who claimed these occurences were common in the Ural Mountains.

                     The lightning scenario suggests that the hikers fled their tent after ball lightning got
                     dangerously close, causing them to head for the tree line. Burn marks found on the nearby trees, as
                     well as injuries found on Doroshenko and Krivonischenko are attributed to a lightning strike, while
                     the pulverised bodies of those found in the ravine are explained by a larger strike or an explosion
                     caused by a positive polarity strike. Slobodin, who was badly injured, was supposedly helped by
                     Kolmogorova to get back to their tent, but both died en route, with Dyatlov himself passing from
                     hypothermia.

                     Methanol Poisoning
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     The suggestion that the Dyatlov expedition group may have acted irrationally leading up to their
                     deaths due to methanol poisoning is one of the more vague theories, but one that has its
                     supporters. The minor symptoms of methanol poisoning include poor coordination, abdominal pain,
                     vomiting, decreased vision, and a decreased level of consciousness.
                     <br /><br />
                     It is thought that there are three ways in which the group may have been exposed to methanol: An
                     aircraft carrying iodine-131 methanol solution may have spilled some of its cargo onto the pass,
                     someone introduced methanol-based stove fuel to cook food, or the hikers drank their medicinal
                     alcohol to warm themselves.
                     <br /><br />
                     There is no data that supports evidence of an aircraft passing the area on the night of the
                     incident, and the stove used by the group was said to have been only used with wood. Interestingly,
                     a small flask was identified by investigator Vasiliy Tempalov on discovery of the hikers' tent that
                     contained medicinal alcohol. Dyatlov himself also made note that Yudin was unable to obtain alcohol
                     for the journey.

                     Due to similarities in both the Chivruay and Dyatlov incidents: The underdressed bodies of the
                     hikers; divisions of the group members; and descending down a slope in single-file, comparisons
                     have been drawn to the cause of the hikers' erratic behaviour before their deaths.

                     Arctic hysteria is a condition mostly observed in people native to arctic regions, such as Eskimos,
                     rather than hiking visitors. The cause of the condition is uncertain, though Rachel D. Higgs, an
                     undergraduate student at Macalester College summises a number of reasons in her college article,
                     <i>Pibloktoq - A study of a culture-bound syndrome in the circumpolar region</i>, such as stress,
                     malnutrition or outside stressors.

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     During the investigation of the Dyatlov incident, it was speculated that the indigenous Mansi
                     tribe, whose territory includes Kholat Syakhl, may have murdered the hikers. A Mansi chum (a
                     tipi-like structure) was found a short distance from the location that the Dyatlov expedition group
                     set up their tent, with a trail leading to the chum just 200m past the hikers' camping ground. The
                     grievious injuries found on the hikers may have been attributed to local hunters who would
                     supposedly have known the area and known how to cover their tracks after commiting such a murder.

                     <br /><br />
                     To add fuel to this theory, it is believed that sacred Mansi grounds were dotted around the Ural
                     Mountains, with the Mansi being a particularly mystic group of people. If the group were to stumble
                     upon such culturally significant territory, it could have led to a conflict, supporting the idea
                     that the group may have been forced from their tent and marched down the hill in single-file before
                     being killed.
                     <br /><br />
                     However, according to the witness testimony of Anyamov Andrey Aleekseevich, a Mansi, there are no
                     sacred areas near where the hikers were camping, and due to none of the hikers' belongings being
                     stolen, a motive for Mansi to have committed the crime has never been substantiated.

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     In <i>The Pass of Dyatlova</i>, author Aleksey Rakitin suggests that some of the members of the
                     Dyatlov
                     expedition group may have been undercover KGB agents seeking to uncover a cell of CIA agents.
                     Certain details about the group lend credence to this possibility: Zolotaryov, a military trained
                     adult who fought for the NKVD, was added to the expedition last minute; Krivonischenko worked at
                     plant Mayak which underwent a nuclear disaster in 1957; and Kolevatov previously worked at a
                     top-secret atomic facility known only as "PO Box 3394".
                     <br /><br />
                     Rakitin goes on to point out that the meeting of such a group must have been more than coincidence,
                     and has the air of the KGB surrounding it. He summarises his theory with the idea that the true
                     objective at Dyatlov Pass was to hand-deliver radioactive materials to CIA operatives, something
                     went wrong at the meeting, and the CIA killed the group of hikers.

                     The Otorten Mountains were known to have been used to launch meteorological rockets, one of which
                     could have collided with one or more radiosondes: a balloon-like probe filled with a radioactive
                     isotope, spilling the contents over the pass. These highly toxic chemicals could have been absorbed
                     into the bodies of the hikers, killing them, but leaving little to no evidence due to oxidation.
                     <br /><br />
                     Evidence in favour of this theory lie in the bodies of the hikers, with their organs showing some
                     signs of toxic damage that line up with certain sulphur compounds as well as the discolouration of
                     their skin resembling those suffering from phosphorous poisoning.

                     A popular theory is that the Dyatlov expedition group fell foul of Soviet soldiers simply for being
                     in the wrong place at the wrong time.
                     <br /><br />
                     One version of the theory suggests that the group, who were taking photos, were seen photographing
                     something they shouldn't have and were killed for the evidence. Another version posits that the
                     group were mistaken for gulag escapees and hunted down, while another is that the group were
                     killed in a military "clean-up" operation.

                     death by soldiers to where they were found in order to cover up locations of a secret missile base.
                     He goes so far as to detail how "staged workers" showed up on the scene before search parties
                     arrived.

                     There have been differing reports as to whether or not alcohol was found upon discovery of the
                     Dyatlov hikers' tent. Yuri Yudin later claimed that the group did not bring alcohol on the
                     expedition, despite a small flask being found by investigator Vasiliy Tempalov that contained
                     alcohol, and despite Dyatlov himself listing vodka in the provisions list.

                     Injuries sustained on the Dyatlov expedition team before death indicate bruising and minor
                     abrasions in-line with blunt force, such as a fist, tree branch or weapon of some sort. Dyatlov
                     himself featured bruising on his knuckles from what seemed like a fist fight.

                     There are a number of indicators that could suggest animals were the cause of the Dyatlov
                     expedition group's demise. Tracks identified as those belonging to wolves and wolverines were found
                     in the Auspiya area, according to the witness testimony of Anyamov Andrey Aleekseevich, a Mansi
                     native.

                     It's believed that the Dyatlov expedition group were cutting loin and eating when something made
                     them abandon the tent, suggesting a possible animal attack. Damage to the tent could have been
                     caused by a wolf or wolverine, and the discarding of clothing could have been due to a foul odour
                     secreted by wolverines when threatened.

                     In 2014, the Discovery Channel aired a documentary entitled <i>Russian Yeti: The Killer Lives</i>
                     that explored the possibility that the cryptid known as a "Yeti" was responsible for the deaths of
                     the Dyatlov expedition group.

                     A yeti is a bipedal mammalian creature resembling an ape. It is often
                     depicted covered in thick, white hair; and may or may not have claws, sharp teeth and ridged horns.
                     Its imposing size dwarfs that of a humans, and is believed to be incredibly strong.
                     Similar to "Bigfoot", the Yeti is an elusive cryptid, but is said to be found in mountainous, snowy
                     regions. The idea that the hikers encountered something threatening, causing them
                     to flee their tent and ultimately killed has been considered, with some of the scene explainable by
                     a such a creature.
                     <br /><br />
                     Injuries sustained by the hikers, such as bruising, internal bleeding and crush damage could be
                     attributed to blunt-force trauma, potentially from something large attacking them. This could also
                     explain the bruising found on Dyatlov's hands, as if defending himself from something.

                     The scattering of the bodies across the mountain pass may have been from something large
                     man-handling the group, or simply the hikers running away from their pursuer.
                     <br /><br />
                     The biggest piece of evidence that has fuelled the yeti theory stems from photos recovered from
                     Thibeaux-Brignolle's camera, which reveal a dark figure lurking in the distance, seeming to be
                     watching or stalking the group. Additionally, it was found that the hikers were writing a
                     faux-newspaper while they travelled, which included details on what the hikers had done, but also
                     contained the line "the Yeti lives in the Northern Urals, near Mount Otorten".

                     The theory that the Dyatlov expedition group encountered something extraterrestrial all hinges on

                     Lead investigator, Lev Ivanov made a statement during an interview in the 1990s that he noticed
                     that the pine trees in the forest that the hikers took refuge amongst were burnt:

                     any other system. There was no epicenter. This once again confirmed a source of heat ray or
                     completely unknown to us energy acting selectively - the snow was not melted, the trees were not
                     damaged. It seemed like when the hikers walked on their feet more than five hundred meters down
                     from the mountain, someone dealt with some of them as direct targets.

                     The injuries to the bodies of the hikers have been compared to those found on dead cattle that are
                     sometimes found with surgical-like wounds or pieces of their anatomy missing, often attributed to
                     extraterrestrial activity.

                     The hardest piece of evidence comes from a photograph taken on Krivonischenko's camera, which
                     shows what looks like lights in the night sky.
