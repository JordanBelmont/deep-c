                  <p>
                     As World War II came to a close in mid 1945, the Allied and Soviet forces marched through a
                     conquered Germany. With the Nazis out of the way, and a mutual enemy defeated, the U.S.
                     believed it would need to maintain technological superiority over the Soviet Union as a national
                     security imperative. The Allies scrambled to capture important Nazi scientists and technological
                     assets before the Soviets could get their hands on them.
                     <br /><br />
                     Under President Harry Truman's authorization, "Operation Paperclip" was initiated, which saw around
                     1,600 Nazi scientists, engineers and technicians recruited by the U.S under the guise of
                     "denazification".
                     <br /><br />
                     The outcome of the operation led to numerous Nazi scientists aiding in the advancement of rocket
                     technology, such as the development of V-2 rockets and the Apollo program's Saturn V rocket that
                     enabled the U.S. to win the space race. Other German scientists and chemists would go on to
                     continue developing chemical weapons, and contribute to more covert programs, such as <a

                     </a>.
                     <br /><br />
                     The operation raised ethical questions, with many of the Nazi scientists having direct ties to WWII
                     atrocities, details that were erased by the U.S. government, indicating that the Allies prioritised
                     technological advancement over moral accountability.

                     History

                  <p>
                     In 1944, U.S. intelligence, including the Office of Strategic Service (precursor to the CIA) began
                     collecting data on Nazi scientists of significance, particularly those involved in rocketry and
                     aviation, due to Germany's impressive V-2 missile technology.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1945, WWII came to a close, with the U.S. subsequently launching "Operation Overcast", which saw
                     Allied forces capturing around 1,600 German scientists in a bid to recruit them before the Soviet
                     Union could.
                     <br /><br />
                     On September 3, President Harry Truman authorized Operation Paperclip, enabling the U.S. to
                     covertly
                     recruit scientists with close ties to the Nazi regime, allowing them to avoid prosecution at the
                     upcoming Nuremberg Trials.
                     <br /><br />
                     In August, the Potsdam Conference saw the distribution of German technology among the Allies.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1946, the first wave of 350 German scientists arrived in the U.S. under Project Paperclip. These
                     scientists were given immediate citizenship and employment at army facilities. The operation was
                     brought to the attention of the public in December through an article entitled "German Scientist
                     Says American Cooking Tasteless; Dislikes Rubberized Chicken" that featured ex-Nazi Scientist
                     Walther Riedel.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1947, Paperclip expanded to include medical and chemical experts. The CIA was created, with
                     several Nazi scientists going on to take key intelligence roles.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1948, prominent Nazi Scientist Werner von Braun helped develop the Redstone missile, setting the
                     stage for his later work at NASA.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1949, the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency expunged Nazi records to help incoming Nazi
                     scientists bypass immigration bans.
                     <br /><br />
                     Between 1951 to 1954, Paperclip peaked, with 1,600 German relocations having taken place.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1955, a number of Nazi chemical experts, including Kurt Blome, were recruited through Paperclip
                     to contribute to the early phases of Project MKUltra.
                     <br /><br />
                     1958 saw incresed U.S. investment in space exploration due to the Soviet's launch of the Sputnik
                     satellite. This led to the creation of NASA, with von Braun becoming the director of the Marshall
                     Space Flight Center.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1959, Paperclip came to its official end, with around 1,600 scientists being relocated to the
                     U.S.
                     <br /><br />
                     In July, 1969, von Braun applied his V-2 missile technology to the Saturn V rocket used in Apollo
                     11, enabling the U.S. to win the space race against the Soviet Union by landing it successfully on
                     the moon.
                     <br /><br />
                     By 1979, public pressure to oust Nazi war criminals being covered up reached a fever pitch. The
                     Department of Justice established the Office of Special Investigations to assist the CIA in
                     deportations.

                  <p>
                     Operation Paperclip saw around 1,600 German scientists covertly integrated into the U.S. While many
                     would go on to be somewhat unremarkable, there were a number of those brought over that would
                     assist North America in staying ahead of the rest of the world in technological advances.

                  <p>
                     By far the most famous asset obtained by the U.S. through Paperclip, Wernher von Braun was an
                     aerospace engineer, and the mastermind behind the Nazi's development of the V-2 rocket that rained
                     down upon Allied cities during WWII.
                     <br /><br />
                     Due to labour shortages, Von Braun's rocket program was developed using concentration camp
                     prisoners as slaves. Former Nazi prisoners went on to state that von Braun would show indifference
                     to the plight of the slaves, would participate in punishments, and would cherry pick labourers from
                     concentration camps personally:

                     The German scientists led by Prof. Wernher von Braun were aware of everything daily. As they
                     went along the corridors, they saw the exhaustion of the inmates, their arduous work and their
                     pain. Not one single time did Prof. Wernher von Braun protest against this cruelty during his
                     frequent stays at Dora. Even the aspect of corpses did not touch him: On a small area near the
                     ambulance shed, inmates tortured to death by slave labor and the terror of the overseers were
                     piling up daily. But, Prof. Wernher von Braun passed them so close that he was almost touching the
                     corpses.

                     them stationed in fortified bases. On capture, Dornberger was imprisoned by the British for the use
                     of slave labour in the rocket program before being handed over to the U.S., where they warned that
                     he was not to be trusted.

                     Operation Surgeon
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     Considered to be the British version of Paperclip, Operation Surgeon was a covert mission whose aim
                     was to forcibly remove scientists and technicians from Germany to deny their skills to
                     the Soviet Union and bolster their own post-war technology.
                     <br /><br />
                     In total, the operation saw the removal of some 1,500 German scientists from their country, with
                     100 choosing to stay and find employment in the UK.

                     Operation Osoaviakhim
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     While the Allies were sweeping across Germany and scooping up German scientists in their own covert
                     operations, the Soviet Union were enacting their own operation to take German scientists, engineers
                     and technicians back to Russia as war reparations, and have them replicate their work for the Nazis
                     to bolster the Soviet Union's weapons technology.
                     <br /><br />
                     Operation Osoaviakhim saw the capture of around 2,500 German specialists, and a total of 4,000
                     Germans, who were all taken back to the Soviet Union.
