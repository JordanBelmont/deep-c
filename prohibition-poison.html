                     Between 1920 to 1933, the United States underwent what has come to be known as the Prohibition Era:
                     a statewide crackdown on the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages. The Prohibition
                     was brought on by a combination of progressive reform, moral and religious beliefs, economic and
                     health advocation, and political pressure.
                     <br /><br />
                     Many who opposed the new legislature would continue to drink, produce and sell alchohol illegally
                     and in secret, with criminals repurposing stolen industrial alcohol as one of their main methods of
                     redistribution.
                     <br /><br />
                     As a response, the government demanded that increased numbers of toxins be used in industrial
                     alcohol, knowingly causing widespread sickness and death, and considering it largely collateral
                     damage and a means to an end.

                     On January 16, 1919, Prohibition was introduced nationwide under the 18th Amendment to the
                     United States Constitution. The amendment outlined the legal framework for Prohibition that the
                     entire country would have to abide by.

                     On October 28, 1920, the Volstead Act was passed by Congress, which allowed the U.S. Government to
                     enforce the 18th Amendment. The Volstead Act would define what constituted as an "intoxicating
                     liquor" and established penalties for its usage and distribution.
                     <br /><br />
                     In late 1926, new mandates saw companies adding additional, or increased levels of toxins to
                     their denatured alcohol.
                     <br /><br />
                     On December 24, New York City's Bellevue Hospital admitted 60 patients, leading to 8 deaths.
                     <br /><br />
                     On January 1, 1927, the death toll rose to 41 in Bellevue Hospital alone.
                     <br /><br />
                     That year, Philadelphia reported 307 deaths, Chicago reported 163 deaths, and a Kansas county
                     reported around 15,000 poisonings. Cities reported large influxes of patients suffering from
                     gastrointestinal distress and chronic kidney damage, while hospitals recorded numerous cases of
                     heart palpitations and respiratory distress linked to tainted alcohol. New York City seized
                     480,000 gallons of liquor, with 98% containing toxic additives.
                     <br /><br />
                     Despite the mounting casualties, the government were undeterred and continued to poison the
                     alcohol supplies. Seymour Lowman, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, who was in charge of
                     enforcing Prohibition laws commented:

                     In 1928, enforcement of Prohibition intensified, with around 75,000 arrests made. This, however,
                     did not deter non-compliance, as the popularity of speakeasies flourished. New York Chief
                     Medical Examiner Charles Norris, estimated that nearly all the liquor in New York City was toxic.
                     He went on to speak out against the deliberate poisoning of citizens, and put the responsibility
                     directly onto the government:

                     absorbing that poison. Knowing this to be true, the United States government must be charged with
                     the moral responsibility for the deaths that poisoned liquor causes, although it cannot be held

                     Capone's bootlegging industry, and highlighted the Prohibition's impact on escalating crime.

                     In 1931, public opinion on Prohibition started to rapidly plummet. The ongoing Great Depression

                     intensified

                        Industry heavies such as John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Henry Ford gave their initial support to
                        Prohibition by providing financial backing to anti-alcohol groups. Rockefeller would go on to
                        later oppose the movement for its failures.

                        shine a spotlight on the failures of Prohibition by reporting on the rise of bootlegging as well
                        as the consequence of poisoning alcohol.

                     A major consequence of the Prohibition Era was the rise in the criminal element who took it upon
                     themselves to illegally produce, smuggle and sell their own alcoholic beverages. These people, or
                     "Bootleggers" as they were dubbed, would distill homebrews, such as beer, wine, bathtub gin and
                     moonshine, all while evading the law.
                     <br /><br />
                     Al Capone, the criminal mob boss and co-founder of the Chicago Outfit, used Prohibition to help
                     build his criminal empire under the guise of providing a public service of supply and demand to
                     people on both sides of the divide:

                     One of the more effective crimes that became a staple of bootleggers, was stealing and repurposing
                     industrial alcohol, which was often used for paints and solvents. In a bid to deter bootleggers
                     from utilising industrial alcohol, the U.S. government responded by further poisoning it through a
                     process referred to as "denaturing".

                  <p>
                     The denaturing process, which began much earlier than the Prohibition Era, saw toxic substances
                     being added to industrial alcohol in order to make it undrinkable. Bootleggers would hire chemists
                     to distill the chemicals out of industrial alcohol, thereby making it safe for consumption.
                     <br /><br />
                     When the Volstead Act outlined the methods in which the government could enforce Prohibition, the
                     Treasury Department ordered manufacturers to increase the amount of toxic substances to their
                     product, or add new ones, to the point that bootleggers could no longer distill the alcohol to safe
                     levels. These substances included the following:

                     The fallout of intensifying the denaturing process was devastating. The increase in
                     methanol saw between 50,000 to 100,000 US citizens become paralysed or blind, New York City
                     alone reported over 1,200 cases of sickness, paralysis and blindness, with estimates of around 750
                     total deaths. Though total numbers are only estimated, it is believed that around 10,000 deaths
                     were caused due to Prohibition poisoning.

                     The long-term effects of the Prohibition would see an erosion of public trust in officials and

                     In a September 1991 issue of <i>Milibank Quarterly</i>, Harry G. Levine and Craig Reinarman claimed
                     that the U.S. government used Prohibition as a framework for the 1971 War on Drugs, utilising its
                     tactics, moral grandstanding and enforcement procedures:

                     The American temperance movement and Prohibition provided the major historical model for drug
                     prohibition. The anti-alcohol crusade developed a single-minded focus on passing laws to outlaw the
                     manufacture and sale of alcohol, a strategy repeated in the war on drugs. Both prohibition
                     movements have used law enforcement to try to suppress supply and demand, both have increased the
                     price and potency of the prohibited substances, and both have fostered organized crime and black
