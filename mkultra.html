                  <p>
                     Project MKUltra was a U.S. government program that began in 1953 and was ran by the Central
                     Intelligence Agency under chemist and spymaster Sidney Gottlieb. The goal of the program was to see
                     if a subject's resolve could be weakened, or their mind and body could be controlled without their
                     knowledge,
                     <br /><br />
                     The methodology employed by agents and scientists of the program has been deemed as illegal
                     human experimentation, and included everything from hypnosis, indoctrination, and sensory
                     deprivation, to physical and mental torture, and the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD.
                     <br /><br />
                     The program often violated the individual rights of its subjects, including those of ordinary U.S.
                     and Canadian citizens, who were experimented on without their consent. The program was officially
                     dissolved in 1973.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1975, declassified information of MKUltra was revealed to the public by the
                     Church Committee, but due to CIA Director Richard Helms' order that all documents pertaining to
                     MKUltra be destroyed, details of the program can only be pieced together from witness testimonies
                     and the few remaining documents, leaving much of MKUltra shrouded in mystery.

                     History
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                     In 1947, the U.S. Navy began Project Chatter: a program that would identify and test drugs for the
                     purpose of interrogation and recruitment.
                     <br /><br />
                     On December 26, 1948, Cardinal József Mindszenty was imprisoned for speaking out against Hungary's
                     Communist regime. After being subjected to both physical and mental torture for 39 days, he
                     confessed to a number of fabricated crimes, to reestablish communism and undermine capitalism in
                     Hungary.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1950, the CIA initiated Project Bluebird: a program that delved into the effectiveness of
                     hypnosis and psychological manipulation in interrogations.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1951, Project Bluebird was folded into Project Artichoke: a program that took the findings of
                     Bluebird and expanded on them by incorporating the use of drugs and biological agents.
                     <br /><br />
                     In the early 1950s, the CIA rolled out a number of other covert operations, such as Project MKDELTA
                     and Project MKNAOMI, that combined the experimentation of previous projects and used them in the
                     field, particularly overseas. This also marked a collaboration between the CIA and the Department
                     of Defense in developing mind control techniques.
                     <br /><br />
                     On February 23, 1953, U.S. Marine Colonel Frank Schwable broadcast on Chinese radio that
                     the U.S. was using germ warfare during the Korean War. This claim was broadcast globally, and
                     though it was later attributed to psychological pressure rather than factual evidence, it suggested
                     that Chinese interrogation methods could break the will of U.S. military personnel.
                     <br /><br />
                     That same year, as the Korean War came to an end, 21 American POWs chose to defect to China rather
                     than repatriate to the U.S. This proved to U.S. intelligence that the Chinese and Soviets were
                     successfully employing indoctrination techniques, highlighting a weakness in military personnel
                     that left the country open to infiltration.
                     <br /><br />
                     On April 13, 1953, CIA Director Allen Dulles authorised the formation of Project MKUltra: a program
                     that would further develop behavioral manipulation techniques after absorbing Projects Bluebird and
                     Artichoke. MKUltra would focus on using a combination of drugs, hypnosis and physical trauma to
                     develop interrogation techniques and convert captives.
                     <br /><br />
                     From 1953 to 1955, MKUltra developed further subdivisions at Stanford, McGill and Columbia
                     Universities. These institutes experimented with the administering of drugs to create a "truth
                     serum", the usage of hypnosis to implant suggestions, and the implementation of sensory deprivation
                     and electroshock to fracture the minds of test subjects.
                     <br /><br />
                     MKUltra would go on to collaborate with MKNAOMI at Fort Detrick, adding biological agents
                     to its extensive mind controlling repertoire.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1954, The CIA launched Operation Midnight Climax: an experiment that saw the drugging of
                     unwitting civilians in an attempt to observe the effects of LSD in a real-world setting.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1957, CIA Inspector General Lyman B. Kirkpatrick conducted a review of CIA operations, including
                     MKUltra. His report pointed out a lack of oversight and accountability, ethical violations, and a
                     potential for exposure as just some of his concerns. Despite this, the program continued
                     undeterred.
                     <br /><br />
                     That same year, MKUltra Subproject 68, also known as the Montreal Experiments, begin at the Allan
                     Memorial Institute of McGill University.
                     <br /><br />
                     By the 1960s, MKUltra had further expanded its experimentation, adding radiation testing,
                     psychological torture, and lobotomisation of subjects to its studies. Subprojects of the project
                     saw the increased use of LSD on diverse populations.
                     <br /><br />
                     On October 16, 1962, The Cuban Missile Crisis began, seeing a 13-day confrontation between the U.S.
                     and the Soviet Union. The tension highlighted the importance of MKUltra, pushing its budget to its
                     peak.
                     <br /><br />
                     1964 saw MKUltra undergo a budget cut due to inconsistent results and growing scrutiny. The project
                     was restructured, with many of its subprojects transferring over to MKSEARCH.
                     <br /><br />
                     As the 1960s continued on, MKSEARCH became recognised as MKUltra's successor, replacing unreliable
                     drugs with more potent compounds, and splitting drug testing and the acquisition of foreign drugs
                     between Project MKOFTEN and Project MKCHICKWIT.
                     <br /><br />
                     Between 1965 to 1967, MKCHICKWIT gathered intelligence on European and Asian drug developments and
                     supplying them to MKOFTEN, which began conducting experiments on test subjects from Edgewood
                     Arsenal
                     and Holmesburg Prison.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1969, President Richard Nixon implemented a ban on the use and storage of biological weapons,
                     directly impacting MKNAOMI's experimentation with agents and toxins, and hampering its
                     collaboration with MKSEARCH.
                     <br /><br />
                     1971 saw the funding for MKSEARCH dry up, though testing continued under other CIA budgets.
                     <br /><br />
                     The Watergate Scandal of June 17, 1972, saw government activities come under heavy scrutiny,
                     leading to mounting pressure aimed at the CIA and the fear of discovery.
                     <br /><br />
                     In January, 1973, CIA Director Richard Helms ordered the destruction of classified records and
                     reports relating to MKUltra, MKSEARCH, MKOFTEN and MKCHICKWIT, to avoid exposure. In total, around
                     20,000 documents were destroyed.
                     <br /><br />
                     Later that year, MKUltra and MKSEARCH are officially dissolved amid growing concern from the public
                     and congress.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1975, The Church Committee opened an investigation into abuses conducted by the CIA. Any
                     remaining documents exposed MKUltra, MKSEARCH, and any subsidary programs for their
                     unethical experimentation.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1977, additional documents were released, exposing the non-consensual experiments performed
                     by MKUltra. The public became outraged by the details of psychological and physical harm enacted
                     upon U.S. citizens, fuelling a distrust in government.
                     <br /><br />
                     From 1977 to the 1990s, a slew of investigations took place, followed by lawsuits that sought
                     compensation from MKUltra victims. While the CIA went on to acknowledge ethical breaches,
                     disclosure was limited due to the destruction of the majority of classified documents.
                     <br /><br />
                     As of the 2000s, the legacy of MKUltra has left a sour taste in the mouths and minds of
                     many, fuelling conspiracy theories, the most notable of which being Project Monarch: the supposed
                     latest iteration of MKUltra.

                  <p>
                     Project MKUltra was known to have a total of 149 subprojects, each with their own number
                     designations. Many of these subprojects were conducted in seemingly innocuous settings, such as
                     hospitals, universities and safehouses, all bankrolled by the CIA as a front for their illegal
                     experimentations.

                     Subproject 3: Operation Midnight Climax
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     In 1954, Sidney Gottlieb oversaw the launch of Operation Midnight Climax: an experiment to see if a
                     combination of drugs (usually LSD) and sex could be used as effective mind control or interrogation
                     techniques.
                     Gottlieb took the interrogation methodology of Project Artichoke from laboratory experimentation
                     to field testing after being given permission to perform his tests on unsuspecting citizens.
                     <br /><br />
                     The operation saw prostitutes on the CIA payroll luring unsuspecting clients to a network of
                     CIA-run safehouses across New York City and San Francisco. Once there, the clients would
                     be unwittingly drugged with numerous substances before having intercourse. Having been trained in
                     questioning techniques, the prostitutes would then attempt to extract secrets from their clients
                     while CIA operatives observed and recorded these tests through one-way glass.
                     <br /><br />
                     Further experimentations would see the client subjected to subliminal messaging to manipulate them
                     into criminal actions, such as robbery, assault and assassination. Other clients were drugged and
                     imprisoned for long stretches of time, to see the efficacy of drugs combined with isolation.
                     <br /><br />
                     When the operation expanded, the CIA began testing drugs on people in restaurants, bars and
                     beaches.
                     <br /><br />
                     It was hinted in Stephen Kinzer's 2019 book, <i>Poisoner in Chief; Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA
                        Search for Mind Control</i> that a blatant disregard of professionalism may have been conducted
                     during the experiments by several of those involved in overseeing the operation:
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <blockquote class="quote mx-6 text-justify">
                     "One project was 'Operation Midnight Climax.' Gottlieb himself took advantage of this 'ready access
                     to prostitutes."
                     <br /><br />
                     "In the early 1950s, Gottlieb hired this guy, George Hunter White, to run a safe house for him in
                     New York City to which
                     people would be lured off the street and then given LSD so CIA officers could watch them from an
                     adjoining apartment
                     through a one-way mirror. Later, White was moved to San Francisco, where he set up one of the
                     craziest MKUltra projects
                     that was known inside the agency as Operation Midnight Climax. This was an operation in which White
                     would assemble a
                     stable of prostitutes who would bring their men back to an apartment that the CIA hired and
                     furnished, feed them LSD and
                     George Hunter White would sit in an adjoining apartment sitting on a portable toilet, drinking
                     pitchers of martinis
                     while watching people having sex under the influence of LSD with the vague idea that this was
                     somehow going to help the
                     United States defeat communism."

                  <p>
                     Starting in 1954, The Georgetown Experiments began when the CIA funnelled $375,000 in funding
                     through a philanthropic cut-out, the Geschickter Fund for Medical Research, led by Dr. Charles
                     Geschickter, to build an annex at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.
                     <br /><br />
                     Named the Gorman Annex, one-sixth of the building was dedicated to illegal CIA experimentations
                     conducted on a host of unwitting test subjects. Due to the setup, the CIA would have been separated
                     enough to maintain plausible deniability in order to keep their hands clean.
                     <br /><br />
                     Due to the 1973 destruction of classified documents, the specifics on experiments and subjects has

                     The proposed technique for the concussive blast involved using low-frequency sound waves (below 20
                     Hz) to create a vibrational impact on a subjects brain, causing amnesia or disorientation without
                     leaving physical evidence.
                     <br /><br />
                     Though details are scarce due to the destruction of classified files in 1973, it is known that the
                     subproject was never fully enacted, being noted as a "non-starter" in declassified documents.
                     Whether this was due to technical limitations or ethical concerns is unknown.

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     The Montreal Experiments saw Canadian citizens becoming unwitting guineau pigs for mind
                     manipulation techniques at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University between 1957 and 1964.
                     <br /><br />
                     Patients would check in to the institute for a mixture of ailments, ranging from post-partum
                     depression, alcoholicism, and even physical issues like arthritis. Nonetheless, these patients were
                     all considered viable test subjects for the program.
                     <br /><br />
                     The CIA funded project was helmed by Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron, who would attempt to erase
                     his subject's minds and replace their memories using a combination of psychological and physical
                     torture methods he called "depatterning".
                     <br /><br />
                     Among his methodology, Dr. Cameron employed everything from drug-induced comas using thorazine,
                     intensive electroshock therapy, sensory deprivation, and his self-made "psychic driving" technique
                     which saw subjects bombarded by recorded messages repeating a mix of positive and negative phrases
                     for up to 16 hours a day:

                     Patients would exit the program with a myriad of psychological issues, such as amnesia, migraines,
                     anxiety, mood swings, and in extreme cases, would forget basic human functions and be reduced to
                     child-like states.
                     <br /><br />
                     The experiments ended with the termination of MKUltra in 1973. Dr. Cameron died of a heart

                     The exact number of victims of the Montreal Experiments is unknown, but in 1988, a class action
                     lawsuit against the CIA and Canadian government saw nine victims of the experiments receive around
                     $67,000 each, while compensation of $100,000 was given to 77 individuals from the Canadian
                     government in 1992. Despite this, over 300 people applied for the compensation, but many were
                     denied, citing late applications, a lack of medical records, or simply not being tortured enough.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 2017, Alison Steel, daughter of victim Jean Steel reached an out-of-court settlement with the
                     Canadian government, awarding her $100,000 in exchange for signing a non-disclosure agreement.

                     Subproject 119: The UCLA Bioelectric Program
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     Beginning in 1960 at UCLA's Brain Research Institute, Subproject 119 focused on the study of
                     bioelectric signals from the human brain and the possibility of controlling a subjects behaviour
                     using remote electronics.
                     <br /><br />
                     Led by neuroscientists Dr. Mary Brazier and Dr. Ross Adey, the project involved a thorough analysis
                     of literature on EEG technologies and bioelectric signals. The duo explored the possibility of
                     manipulating extremely-low brainwaves through the use of electromagnetic fields.
                     <br /><br />
                     The project was funded by the CIA for around $5,947, though it was hampered by the technological
                     limitations of the time, leaving the project to mostly produce research publications instead of
                     practical applications.
                     <br /><br />
                     It is thought that the program may have seen involvement from Saul B. Sells, a professor of social
                     psychology at Texas Christian University, who proposed building an advanced EEG machine with
                     the ability to analyze brainwaves and decode thoughts, but the destruction of classified files in
                     1973 ensured any further information on Subproject 119 remained in the dark.

                     Born from fears of Cold War era brainwashing techniques purportedly utilised by the Soviets and
                     Chinese during the Korean War, the U.S. Government went to great lengths, and depths, to conduct
                     its own tests in mind control. While Project MKUltra is one of the more well-known government
                     operations
                     dealing with behavioral control, it wasn't the only one, or even the first.

                  <p>
                     Beginning in 1947, Project Chatter was an initiative conducted by the U.S. Navy that focused on
                     developing and testing "truth serums" for recruitment and interrogation purposes.
                     <br /><br />
                     The goal of the project was to discover chemicals that could reliably extract truthful information
                     from captives, or make them more susceptible to manipulation without the use of physical coercion.
                     <br /><br />
                     Unethical experiments were conducted on both animals and humans to test the viability of
                     psychoactive substances. Many participants were unwilling or non-voluntary, but were exposed to
                     drugs such as LSD, as well as plant-based drugs, such as anabasine, mescaline and scopolamine.
                     <br /><br />
                     The project was terminated in 1953, with its records becoming declassified in 1970. Due to its
                     similarities in dealing with drug-induced mind control, it's likely that Chatter's findings
                     laid the groundwork for MKUltra.

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     Beginning in 1950, Project Bluebird was a CIA program that focused on using hypnosis and
                     psychological manipulation as useful interrogation techniques.
                     <br /><br />
                     Among its many goals, Bluebird sought to induce amnesia, create false memories, implant
                     suggestions and ensure compliance without using physical coercion. Though the project leaned more
                     heavily on hypnosis, it also combined drug use, similar to Chatter, to enhance
                     suggestibility.
                     <br /><br />
                     Experiments saw CIA operatives, military personnel, civilians and captives undergo interrogation
                     simulations and conditioning tests, all in an effort to counter enemy brainwashing techniques while
                     perfecting their own.
                     <br /><br />
                     Bluebird was terminated and absorbed into Project Artichoke in 1951.

                     Beginning in 1951, Project Artichoke was a CIA program that continued where Bluebird left
                     off, but doing and employed more aggressive methods to obtain results.
                     <br /><br />
                     Similar to its predecessors, Artichoke aimed to improve interrogation techniques and study
                     behavioral control through the use of hypnosis, drugs, and biological agents, but a further
                     emphasis was put on inducing people to commit espionage or assassinations.
                     <br /><br />
                     While previous iterations sought compliance without the use of physical coercion, Artichoke
                     subjected its test subjects to torture-like techniques in an attempt to erode resistance.
                     <br /><br />
                     Project Artichoke was terminated and absorbed into MKUltra in 1953.

                     Beginning in the 1950s, Project MKDELTA was a CIA program that served as a precursor to MKUltra.
                     <br /><br />
                     MKDELTA specialised in international clandestine operations, utilising a combination of
                     psychoactive drugs and biochemical agents to destabilise foreign governments, eliminate defectors,
                     and extract information from individual targets.
                     <br /><br />
                     As opposed to laboratory experimentation, the program specialised in field testing, often in
                     dangerous situations that required secrecy.
                     <br /><br />
                     The project was absorbed into MKUltra in the 1960s, with most of its records being destroyed by CIA
                     Director Richard Helms in 1973.

                     Beginning in the 1950s, Project MKNAOMI was a joint CIA / Department of Defense program that ran
                     alongside MKUltra, but has also been noted as its successor.
                     <br /><br />
                     The program put a focus on increasing the biological and chemical warfare capabilities of the U.S.,
                     stockpiling and testing bacterias and toxins that could incapacitate or kill test subjects.
                     <br /><br />
                     As part of its ongoing field tests, the project saw the usage of agents such as anthrax and
                     tularemia, as well as toxins such as shellfish toxin and botulinum to create an arsenal of
                     devastating weapons. Coated darts and aerosol cans became efficient delivery systems on covert
                     missions, while techniques were developed to poison crops, water and food supplies.
                     <br /><br />
                     The project was dissolved in 1970 due to President Richard nixon's ban on the military use and
                     stockpiling of biological weapons and toxins.

                     Beginning around 1964, Project MKSEARCH was a CIA program that picked up where MKUltra left
                     off after its scope was reduced.
                     <br /><br />
                     The program looked to take the findings of MKUltra and produce even more effective methods of
                     mind control through the use of psychoactive drugs and behavioral manipulation techniques.
                     <br /><br />
                     MKSEARCH capitalised on the inconsistent findings of MKUltra due to the ineffectiveness of LSD in
                     behavioral control, and sought out more potent and reliable compounds, such as sodium pentothal,
                     temazepam and amphetamines.
                     <br /><br />
                     The project was terminated in 1973 following increased scrutiny due to the Watergate Scandal.

                     <br /><br />
                     The program focused on the drug refinement portion of MKSEARCH by testing the toxicological effects
                     of drugs on animals and humans.
                     <br /><br />
                     MKOFTEN used LSD, BZ and other compounds on unwitting subjects acquired from Holmesburg Prison and
                     Edgewood Arsenal. Though it hasn't be corroborated, some sources suggest the program also utilised
                     occult practices in its experimentation.

                     started around the 1960s, shortly after MKUltra was dissolved.
                     <br /><br />
                     The brainwashing techniques of Monarch are thought to have been taken directly from Nazi research
                     that was obtained after the U.S. initialised Operation Paperclip.
                     <br /><br />
                     The program is said to specialise in trauma-based mind control techniques performed mostly on
                     children in an effort to create individuals with dissociative identities known as "alters".
                     Test subjects were said to have undergone extreme mental abuse, electroshock and a combination of
                     hypnosis and drugs to create an alter that would service one of five divisions:

                     <p>
                        Alters used for the Alpha division of Monarch were individuals designed with photographic
                        memories.

                        Alters used for the Beta division of Monarch were individuals that underwent sexual
                        programming.

                        Alters used for the Delta division of Monarch were individuals that were trained to perform
                        assassinations.

                     <p>
                        Alters used for the Theta division of Monarch were individuals that showed the potential for
                        using psychic abilities.
                     </p>
                     <li class="fw-bold">

                     <p>
                        Alters used for the Gamma division of Monarch were individuals that were created for
                        deception
                        and espionage.

                     Many people have claimed to have been victims of MKUltra or similar CIA mind control
                     experiments. Some of these claims have been confirmed due to declassified documents, while others
                     have no such evidence, and so are locked in books and online forums as pure speculation or
                     conspiracy theories.

                     Frank Olson
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     Frank Olson was a biological warfare scientist that worked for the United States Army Biological
                     Warfare Laboratories at Fort Detrick from 1942.
                     <br /><br />
                     During his tenure working with the army, Olson helped establish the U.S. bioweapons program and
                     worked
                     alongside ex-Nazi scientists following

                     </a>
                     before being discharged.
                     As a civilian, Olson remained at Detrick, participating in further projects, such as
                     <a href="operation-harness.html"
                        class="text-secondary text-decoration-none fs-6">
                        Operation Harness
                     </a>
                     and
                     <a href="operation-seaspray.html"
                        class="text-secondary text-decoration-none fs-6">
                        Operation Sea-Spray.
                     </a>
                     With the threats of Soviet progress looming, Olson became the acting chief of the newly formed
                     Special Operations Division at Detrick before becoming an employee of the CIA, where he was
                     appointed to the committee for Project Artichoke.
                     <br /><br />
                     As time went on, Olson would participate in countless experiments involving the poisoning,
                     gassing
                     and torture of animals, leading to a feeling of disenfranchisement with the methods of the CIA.
                     After the Korean War came to an end and Operation Big Switch saw the repatriation of numerous
                     POWs,
                     the U.S. felt that the returning captives could prove to be a security risk. After residing over
                     intense debriefing investigations across Europe, Olson returned to the United States convinced
                     that
                     they had used biological weapons during the Korean War.
                     <br /><br />
                     It is believed that Olson went on to confide in British psychiatrist William Sargant about his
                     growing concerns. Sargant subsequently reported that Olson had become a security risk due to his
                     high level access and deep knowledge of the Special Operations Division at Detrick.
                     <br /><br />
                     While on a retreat at Deep Creek Lake in 1953 with some of the closest members of MKUltra, Olson
                     and some
                     of the other attendees were drugged with LSD. On his return, Olson seemed different to
                     those around him, including his family and colleagues. Olson's boss, Lt. Col. Vincent Ruwet
                     recalled Olson seeming disoriented on his return to Detrick.
                     Ruwet would go on to testify that Olson was "mixed up" about the work he had been doing and felt
                     "incompetent" in his field.
                     <br /><br />
                     Olson's situation would worsen when he returned home early one day with a coworker, explaining
                     to
                     his wife that "They're afraid I might hurt you" and that he had agreed to undergo psychiatric
                     treatment. Accompanied by Ruwet and CIA chemist Robert Lashbrook, Olson flew to New York City to
                     meet with a CIA-linked doctor, Harold Abramson.
                     <br /><br />
                     Four days later, Olson would fall to his death from his tenth-floor room at the Statler
                     Hotel. The night manager recalled rushing over to Olson, who was still alive, and was attempting
                     to "mumble something" before succumbing to his wounds. The night manager would later recount:

                     On entering room 1018A, where both Olson and Lashbrook had been staying, the police found
                     Lashbrook sat on the toilet with his head in his hands.
                     <br /><br />
                     Investigations showed that a call had been made from room 1018A to a number listed as belonging
                     to Dr. Harold Abramson. The hotel switchboard operator, who overheard the brief call, recalled the
                     occupant of the room stating "Well, he's gone" and receiving a response of "Well, that's too
                     bad."
                     <br /><br />
                     Police reports stated that Olson purposely threw himself out of the window of his room at the
                     Hotel Statler, which he had been sharing with Lashbrook, and died shortly afterwards. The medical
                     report indicated cuts and abrasions were present on the body.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1994, Olson's body was exhumed by his son, Eric Olson, and a second autopsy was agreed upon.
                     The second autopsy found there to be no cuts or abrasions, but it did reveal a hematoma on the
                     left side of Olson's head, as well as an injury on his chest. Most of the team performing the
                     autopsy
                     agreed that the wounds had likely occurred before the fall, suggesting homicide. Eric Olson
                     would spend many years attempting to clear his father's name, asserting that the forensic evidence
                     portrayed a method of murder found in the CIA manual "A Study of Assassination".

                     Psychiatric Institute following a devastating divorce. During his time at the institute, Blauer
                     was subjected to experiments conducted by the Army Chemical Corps, who had a working relationship
                     with the institute, allowing them to administer chemical compounds that could be used in warfare to
                     their patients.
                     <br /><br />
                     The experiments saw Blauer injected with variations of mescaline, causing him to hallucinate and

                     dose of MDA, with the institute claiming that it was an accidental overdose.

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     In 1954, three year old Chere Jo Horton went missing from the parking lot of the Lazy A bar in San
                     Antonio, Texas. Horton's parents had left her to play outside late at night with her older brother
                     while they entered the bar.
                     <br /><br />
                     As the night progressed, Horton's brother ran into the bar to tell his parents that Chere had
                     disappeared. A search party took place that night, uncovering a car with Horton's underwear hanging
                     from the window. Meanwhile, Jimmy Shaver, an airman from the nearby Lackland Air force Base,
                     emerged topless into a gravel pit. Shaver was reportedly covered in scratches and blood, and had no
                     recollection of how he got there or where he had been. Witnesses described him as "dazed". Further
                     searching revealed Horton's raped and murdered body nearby.
                     <br /><br />
                     Shaver had been to the Lazy A bar that same night with a friend, but reported to the police that
                     neither were drunk, though Shaver seemed "high on something". It was noted that when Shaver's wife
                     came to see him at the county jail, he did not recognise her. He later gave a statement that he
                     recalled a blonde man with tattoos who was responsible for the murder, but later reasoned that he
                     himself must have done it.
                     <br /><br />
                     During the trial, it was revealed that Shaver suffered from debilitating migraines which the
                     air force had recommended he seek treatment in a two-year experimental program for.
                     <br /><br />
                     Jolyon Louis "Jolly" West, a scientist employed by the CIA and an expert in hypnosis, came
                     in to help Shaver recover his memory in aid of his defense. West used a combination of hypnotism
                     and sodium pentothal injections to put Shaver in a trance. While under, Shaver confessed to killing
                     Horton, who he claimed reminded him of "Beth Rainboat", a cousin that had sexually abused him as a
                     child.

                     being treated at the base hospital:

                     <br /><br />
                     Orlikow would be an on-and-off patient for three years, her condition, however, only seemed to

                     <br /><br />
                     Sarah Anne Johnson, Orlikow's granddaughter, scoured through court documents and Orlikow's own
                     diary to look for details on the institute, discovering the horrific truth that lay within its
                     walls.
                     <br /><br />
                     Johnson learned that her grandmother was subjected to high-voltage shock therapy, injected with
                     LSD, and forced into drug-induced comas. Patients of the facility would be reduced to child-like
                     states, unable to perform basic tasks, before being reprogrammed using psychic driving
                     techniques. Subjects would have football helmets strapped to their heads with speakers that
                     repeated a mixture of negative and positive recorded messages for up to 16 hours a day, before
                     resorting to more sinister tactics:

                     subjected to a battery of mental and physical torture.
                     <br /><br />
                     As a subject of experimentation, Weinstein underwent intensive electroshock, sensory isolation, was

                     driving.

                     By the time Weinstein was released from the institute, his ailments evolved into "massive

                     <br /><br />
                     During her stay at the institute, Steel was kept in drug-induced comas, put through intense
                     electroshock therapy, and tested with experimental drugs, leaving her in a child-like state. It was
                     reported in documents obtained from the Candian Department of Justice that, during her stay, Steel
                     would show aggressive behaviour towards the staff at the institute, behaviour that Dr. Cameron felt
                     needed to be "broken up".
                     <br /><br />
                     Steel would spend days at a time in what was dubbed the "sleep room", and on one occassion

                     Wayne Ritchie was a deputy U.S. marshal who was unwittingly drugged when someone slipped LSD into
                     his drink at a Christmas party in 1957.
                     <br /><br />
                     Ritchie claimed that he had four or five drinks before returning to the marshal's office, where he
                     was suddenly overcome with sadness and a sense that everyone had turned on him.
                     <br /><br />
                     Following this, Ritchie dranks some more before driving to Fillmore District bar and attempted to
                     rob the place while brandishing his service revolver. Luckily, Ritchie got distracted and was
                     knocked unconscious.
                     <br /><br />
                     Ritchie went on to plead guilty to attempted robbery, was fined $500, and was given
                     a suspended jail sentence. He spiralled from that point on, quitting his job in disgrace and
                     fighting off thoughts of suicide.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1999, Ritchie read the obituary of MKUltra director, Sidney Gottlieb, which led him to
                     believe he was drugged as part of the CIA testing, especially after finding out that a now-deceased
                     CIA agent may have attended the same Christmas party.

                     Bulger also described how he suffered from violent nightmares, stating in his notes
                     that he heard voices and feared that if anyone found out he would be "committed for life".

                     In 2013, Bulger was found guilty in a racketeering case that involved 11 murders. One of the

                  <p>
                     Considered to be something of a child prodigy, Ted Kaczynski was gifted enough to be accepted into
                     Harvard University in 1958 at the age of 16. A year after his enrollment, Kaczynski was noticed by
                     psychologist Henry A. Murray, who "pressured" him, along with 21 other students, to take part in a
                     study that aimed to better understand the effects of stress on the human psyche.
                     <br /><br />
                     As part of the study, test subjects were instructed to write an essay about their life philosophy
                     with the intent of debating their ethos with a fellow student. Instead, the subjects were monitored
                     by wires and cameras, and made to defend their philosophies against trained lawyers who tore their
                     belief structures apart and humiliated them meticulously at an average of 200 hours across three
                     years.
                     <br /><br />
                     Following his university years, Kaczynski isolated himself from others, becoming a hermit that
                     lived in the woods and harbouring strong technophobic beliefs. He would make a name for himself as
                     the "Unabomber": a domestic terrorist who sent homemade bombs through the mail, killing three
                     people and injuring a further 23. Kaczynski would state that the tests conducted on him at Harvard
                     would shape the man he became:

                     and by extension society, as a machine that crushes individuality. That experience didn't make me
                     the Unabomber, but it planted a seed of anger and distrust that grew over time.”

                     becoming a guineau pig for their mind control experiments.
                     <br /><br />
                     Jones details how she was sent to a CIA psychiatrist (named Jensen, but believed to be Dr. William
                     Kroger) who succeeded in splitting Jones' personality, with one part, named "Arlene Grant", used to
                     carry out covert courier operations without her conscience knowledge.

                  It wasn't until 1977 that documentation was declassified surrounding Project Artichoke

                  direct evidence of her own claims. Jones' book paved the way for other authors to release their

                  which came out in the following years and saw success.

                     Brice Taylor is a self-proclaimed survivor of trauma-based conditioning at the hands of the CIA as
                     part of their Monarch program. Using her pseudonym, "Brice Taylor", she released her book
                     <i>Thanks for the Memories: The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Sex
                        Slave</i> in 1999, which details the methods in which she was systematically deconstructed as a
                     human to be used by world elites.
                     <br /><br />
                     Taylor (a pseudonym) details how she underwent artificially-induced dissociative identity disorder
                     in order to fracture her psyche into different personalities, one referred to as "Sharon". Each of
                     Taylor's personalities were made to perform a specific task, such as storing sensitive information,
                     serving as a courier, or performing as a sex-slave prostitute.
                     <br /><br />
                     Taylor details how she was sold at a slave auction when she was a child to actor and comedian, Bob
                     Hope. She was later introduced to Henry Kissinger to be used as his personal computer filled with
                     classified files that he would access in meetings with NATO, the Trilateral Commission, the Energy
                     Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, and House Appropriations on Foreign Trade.
                     <br /><br />
                     Taylor goes on to explain how she was prostituted out to presidents, governors and top politicians:

                     Her time spent close to the elites gave Taylor further insight into their machinations, including
                     the inner workings of a "Council" that controlled global events from the shadows, much like the
                     <a href="illuminati.html"

                     , with the intention of securing power beyond that of their predecessors. Unfortunately, being
                     so close to the elites meant she was also forced to participate in "satanic rituals" where children
                     and animals were killed.
                     <br /><br />
                     Taylor's own daughter, Kelly, was also mentioned as being subjected to a similar experience, having
                     her mind manipulated to become what the book refers to as a "Bush Baby": a child sex slave for then
                     vice president, George W. Bush.
                     <br /><br />
                     After years of therapy and scouring through her journals, Taylor was able to piece together her
                     memories in order to produce the book. As with Candy Jones' and Candy O'Briens' books, critics
                     remained skeptic due to a lack of evidence.

                     Soon after, Kesey got a job as the night attendant at the Veterans Hospital psychatric ward,
                     allowing him access to a smorgasbord of psychedelics. His time around the patients, combined
                     with his excessive use of LSD, gave him the inspiration to create the 1962 novel <i>One Flew Over
                        the Cuckoo's Nest</i>.
                     <br /><br />
                     Kesey's house on Perry Lane became a beacon to creatives, a melting pot of artists and
                     intellectuals who would all find a place beneath the haze of psychedelics.
                     <br /><br />
                     With the success of his novel, Kesey would go on to purchase a house in San Francisco where he
                     would host drug-fuelled parties he called "Acid Tests". This, it is believed, is how Kesey
                     helped influence the psychedelic movement of the 60s.

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     Charles Milles Manson was the leader of the Manson Family, a California based doomsday cult that
                     committed
                     a series of murders in July and August of 1969, the most infamous of which was the Tate-LaBianca
                     murders.
                     <br /><br />
                     As a youth, Manson would get himself in trouble with the law on a regular basis, finding himself in
                     and out of federal institutes from the age of
                     <br /><br />
                     During the Summer of Love in 1967, Manson became a guru in the Haight-Ashbury District of San
                     Francisco. His philosophical preachings would attract wayward misfits and emerging hippies, helping
                     him amass a following of around 20 people, most of which were girls. These followers became what
                     would come to be known as the "Manson Family".
                     <br /><br />
                     Throughout the year, Manson would get in trouble with the law many times, but despite these
                     incidents being a violation of his parole, his parole officer, Roger Smith, would ensure he
                     faced no severe repurcussions, going so far as to vouch for Manson. Smith held meetings with Manson
                     on a weekly basis at the Haight Ashbury Medical Clinic, an institute funded by the National
                     Institutes of Health, believed to be a front for the CIA. According to journalist Tom O'Neill,
                     Jolyon Louis "Jolly" West, a scientist and hypnotist employed by the CIA, was using the
                     clinic as a testing ground, supplying its young clientele with LSD to see the effects it had on
                     their psyche:

                     In 1968, Manson moved The Family to Spahn Ranch in the California desert, where he would take away
                     their possessions, change their names, and ply them with copious amounts of drugs, such as LSD.
                     Beginning on August 8, 1969, the Manson Family would go on to commit a series of murders, targeting
                     mostly upper-class white victims, and scrawling notes on the walls in blood in order to ignite
                     Helter Skelter, all at the behest of Manson:

                     Clinic, but he points out that the goal of West's studies line up with what The Family ultimately

                     Family member Bobby Beausoleil, the LAPD weren't set on thoroughly investigating The Family for the

                     Eventually, Manson and a number of his Family members would be arrested and put on trial. As this

                     At the conclusion of the trial, Manson and the accused Family members were all found guilty and

                     <br /><br />
                     After the trial, prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi released his book in 1974, <i>Helter Skelter</i>,
                     which painted a narrative that Manson had convinced his followers that an apocalyptic race war
                     would take place, dubbed "Helter Skelter" after his inspiration from the Beatles <i>White
                        Album</i>. His cult were to lay low in a "bottomless pit", as described in the bible, and wait
                     for the Black population to eradicate the White population, with Manson ultimately ruling over
                     those that would be left.

                     prove that Shaw conspired with Lee Harvey Oswald, David Ferrie and others in the CIA to assassinate
                     JFK. A New Orleans resident, Jack Martin, had reported to authorities that Jack Ferrie may have

                     serving in the in the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol. Martin relayed to the FBI that Ferrie might

                  <p>
                     James Earl Ray was the convicted shooter in the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. On April 4,
                     1968.
                     <br /><br />
                     Ray had rented a room across the street from the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, and shot
                     King as he stood on his balcony at the motel. Ray subsequently fled the scene, with his binoculars
                     and Remington rifle found abandoned close by. Once captured, Ray entered a guilty plea and was
                     sentenced to 99 years in prison.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1999, Loyd Jowers, the owner of Jim's Grill located close to the Lorraine Motel, confessed to
                     being part of a conspiracy involving the Mafia and U.S. government to assassinate King:

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     On June 5, 1968, Sirhan Sirhan, a Jordanian man, was convicted of the assassination of senator
                     <a href="rfk.html"
                        class="text-secondary text-decoration-none fs-6">
                        Robert F. Kennedy</a>,
                     having fired a gun at him and the crowd while at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Kennedy died
                     at the hospital after receiving three bullets, one in the neck and two in the back,
                     while a fourth bullet passed through his jacket.
                     <br /><br />
                     Like JFK, the assassination sparked a torrent of theories, some claiming that Sirhan was mind
                     controlled to eliminate the senator, while others suspect he may not have been the only shooter.
                     <br /><br />
                     Since the assassination, Sirhan has claimed that he retains no memory of the murder, while
                     witnesses reported that he seemed to be in a trance-like state during the assassination.
                     <br /><br />
                     Journalist Robert Blair Kaiser, who covered the subsequent trial of Sirhan, wrote in his 1970 book
                     <i>R.F.K. Must Die!</i> that Sirhan likely was under the influence of hypnosis, possibly even
                     self-hypnosis, the first to suggest so:

                  <blockquote class="quote mx-6 text-justify">
                     "During the trial, Dr. Diamond programmed Sirhan, under hypnosis, to climb the bars of his cell.
                     Sirhan had no idea what he was doing up on the top of the bars. When he finally discovered that
                     climbing was not his own idea, but Dr. Diamond's, he was struck with the plausibility of the idea
                     that perhaps he had been programmed by someone else, in like manner, to kill Kennedy."

                     Sirhan's lawyer, William F. Pepper, who represented Sirhan during his parole hearings,
                     believed that Sirhan was hypnotised and set up as a diversion for the real RFK gunman:

                     Sirhan's legal team used acoustic expert, Philip Van Praag to analyse the "Pruszynski
                     recording" of Kennedy's assassination. Praag pointed out the sound of 13 gunshots, while Sirhan's
                     gun only held eight bullets, and he had no opportunity to reload, concluding that there was a
                     second gunman involved. Additionally, they believed that the bullet that caused RFK's death, found
                     in his neck, did not match Sirhan's gun.
                     <br /><br />
                     Dr. Edward Simson-Kallas spent time psychoanalysing Sirhan while he was in prison directly after
                     the assassination, and Daniel Brown, an associate clinical professor in psychology at Harvard
                     Medical School, also interviewed Sirhan for 60 hours over the span of 3 years. Both concluded that
                     Sirhan was subject to hypno-programming.

                     The prosecution attorney general, Kamala Harris, refuted the claim, stating that there was no

                     Mark David Chapman
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     On December 8, 1980 Chapman became notorious for assassinating the Beatles frontman John Lennon.
                     Following his arrest and in the years since, theorists have speculated that Chapman may have been
                     subjected to MKUltra-style manipulation techniques in order to kill John Lennon at the behest of
                     the CIA.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1977, Mark David Chapman left the U.S. and relocated to Hawaii, where he was recruited as a
                     missionary by the local YMCA to help council Vietnamese refugees in Arkansas following the vietnam
                     War. He was then sent to Beirut, Lebanon to help refugees before returning to the U.S. due to
                     safety concerns. His struggles with depression led Chapman to attempt suicide by carbon monoxide
                     poisoning, but failing this, he got a job at the Castle Medical Center, the same hospital he
                     recovered in.
                     <br /><br />
                     Theorists look towards key elements surrounding Chapman leading up to the murder, such as his
                     obsession with J.D. Salinger's novel <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, which he had in his possession
                     at the time of the murder, may have been his "trigger" as a supposed programmed assassin. It was
                     reported that Chapman referred to himself as "Holden Caulfield", a character from the book, that
                     theorists believe may be a dissociative personality given to him through MKUltra methods.
                     <br /><br />
                     Lennon had made his anti-Vietnam War beliefs well known leading up to the murder, and theorists
                     believe that his influence may have been seen as subversive enough to warrant drastic measures and
                     serve as the motive to have him assassinated. Released documents confirm that the CIA and FBI were
                     spying on Lennon due to the Nixon administration's concern over disrupting the 1972 Republican
                     convention.
                     <br /><br />
                     In his 1989 book <i>Who Killed John Lennon?</i> Author Fenton Bresler floats the idea that
                     Chapman's ties with the YMCA may have been when he became compromised. The YMCA was part of a
                     larger organisation known as the United States Youth Council: a non-profit coalition
                     that served children, and whose profits it was revealed are mostly from the CIA. Bresler argues
                     that Chapman's work in Beirut and psychiatric history suggest a strong CIA influence.
                     <br /><br />
                     New York police lieutenant Arthur O'Connor, who interrogated Chapman after his arrest, went on to
                     affirm Bresler's suspicions:

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     On July 20, 2012, James Holmes was responsible for murdering 12 people and injuring a further 70 at
                     a movie theatre in Colorado, referred to as the 2012 Aurora theater shooting.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 2006, Holmes worked as an intern at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, there, he was
                     supervised by John Jacobson, whom he referred to as a "mentor". Theorists point to Salk possibly
                     being a CIA funded institute along the lines of Harvard and Stanford, while Jacobson may have
                     served as a "handler" for the CIA as he was, at the time, a PhD candidate in philosophy
                     and cognitive sciences at UC San Diego.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 2011, Holmes went on to study neuroscience as a PhD student at the University of Colorado, an
                     institute funded by the National Institutes of Health, which supposedly had CIA ties. Even
                     Holmes' father was thought to have loose ties to the CIA through his work at HNC Software, a
                     company theorists claim to be linked to DARPA.
                     <br /><br />
                     Holmes' vacant demeanor during court proceedings, along with his claims of amnesia,
                     are thought to be sure signs of personality dissociation from experimentation.
                     <br /><br />
                     Conspiracy theorist and author, Fritz Springmeier, made a number of comments pointing to Holmes
                     being a perfect candidate for MKUltra experimentation:

                     Adam Lanza
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                     On December 14, 2012, 20-year-old Adam Lanza was responsible for killing 26 people at the
                     Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.
                     <br /><br />
                     Lanza had no prior criminal record, but suffered from mental disorders, such as Asperger's
                     syndrome, depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Lanza's father, Peter Lanza,
                     suspected his son may have had undiagnosed schizophrenia.
                     <br /><br />
                     Theorists believe that Lanza may have undergone mental manipulation akin to MKUltra,
                     pointing to his mental condition as a byproduct of CIA behavioral manipulation. The theory
                     elaborated that video games or social media played a part as his supposed "trigger", and that his
                     father's connection with General Electric, who collaborated with the CIA in 2009, may
                     indicate Lanza was experimented on as a child.
                     <br /><br />
                     The crime brought scrutiny upon federal and state gun legislation in the U.S., with many wanting
                     a universal background check system and banning the sales of semi-automatic firearms.
                     <br /><br />
                     Following the shooting, radio host Alex Jones made statements that he believed the shooting was a
                     staged false flag operation to tighten gun control:
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <blockquote class="quote mx-6 text-justify">
                     “There is a reported school shooting in Connecticut - one of the states that has draconian
                     restrictions on gun ownership… The media will hype the living daylights out of this. Why do
                     governments stage these things? To get our guns!”

                     For his comments, Jones has faced several defamation lawsuits, racking up a sizeable debt in
                     compensatory damage claims, and has since claimed he now believes the shooting to have been real.
