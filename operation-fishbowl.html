                     In 1962, the U.S. Department of Defense and Atomic Energy Commission initiated Operation Dominic,
                     36 atmospheric, high-altitude and underwater nuclear tests conducted as a response to the Soviet
                     Union's own weapons testing.
                     <br /><br />
                     The high-altitude component, dubbed Operation Fishbowl, took place at Johnston Island and consisted
                     of nine tests. Of the nine, five were considered a success, with the remaining four as failures.
                     <br /><br />
                     The aim of the operation was to detonate a nuclear weapon in near-space to test the effects of an
                     electromagnetic pulse triggered in high-altitude, to test its impact on electronics and power
                     grids, and to study the auroras and generated radiation belts that followed a nuclear explosion.
                     <br /><br />
                     Operation Fishbowl, and all subsequent nuclear tests came to a halt in 1963 as part of the Limited
                     Test Ban Treaty, though underground testing continued unabated.

                     History

                  <p>
                     In 1961, the Soviet Union ended a three-year nuclear testing moratorium by launching a series of
                     high-altitude missile tests. In response, the U.S. initiated Operation Dominic, a series of 36
                     tests to study the capabilities of nuclear effects, with Operation Fishbowl focusing on
                     high-altitude testing. Johnston Island, a remote Pacific Ocean atoll, was selected as the testing
                     grounds for Operation Fishbowl due to its remote location.
                     <br /><br />
                     On June 2, 1962, the first test of Operation Fishbowl, "Bluegill" was conducted. Due to radar
                     tracking losing the missile mid-flight, the warhead was destroyed with no nuclear detonation taking
                     place.
                     <br /><br />
                     On June 19, the second test, "Starfish", was launched, but the missile began to break apart
                     mid-flight. Once again, the warhead was ordered to be destroyed with no nuclear detonation taking
                     place.
                     <br /><br />
                     On July 8, "Starfish Prime" was launched and was the first to successfully detonate. The detonation
                     generated a radiation belt that lasted for months and caused the destruction of many satellites.
                     <br /><br />
                     On July 25, a second attempt was made at launching Bluegill, dubbed "Bluegill Prime", but was a
                     failure due to malfunction. On the missile's destruction, the area was contaminated by radioactive
                     materials, leading to a halt on operations while the site underwent decontamination.
                     <br /><br />
                     Testing resumed after three months, and on October 15, a third attempt at Bluegill, "Bluegill
                     Double Prime", took place. Once again, a malfunction caused the test to fail.
                     <br /><br />
                     On October 19, another test, "Checkmate", was launched and successfully detonated.
                     <br /><br />
                     On October 25, the final attempt at launching Bluegill, "Bluegill Triple Prime" took place. The
                     launch and subsequent detonation was a success.
                     <br /><br />
                     On November 1, the operation launched "Kingfish", which once again, was considered a success.
                     <br /><br />
                     The final atmospheric test of Operation Fishbowl took place on November 3, which saw "Tightrope"
                     launch a missile successfully detonate the warhead.
                     <br /><br />
                     On August 5, 1963, the Limited Ban Treaty was signed by the U.S., UK, and Soviet Union, banning
                     nuclear tests in the atmosphere, space, and underwater, largely due to the environmental and
                     geopolitical fallout created from Starfish Prime's radiation belt. As a workaround, the U.S.
                     conducts further nuclear tests underground.
                     <br /><br />
                     In 1975, the Church Committee's investigation into the activities of the CIA, FBI and other
                     intelligence agencies declassified documents pertaining to Operation Dominic and Operation
                     Fishbowl, revealing the nature of the nuclear tests to the public. While the tests went a long way
                     to developing an understanding and advancement of nuclear warfare, the risks to civilians and the
                     ecosystem brought much criticism.
                     <br /><br />
                     A report was released in 2010 by the United States Defense Threat Reduction Agency entitled
                     "Collateral Damage to Satellites from an EMP Attack". The report details the damage caused to
                     satellites by artificial radiation belt's generated by nuclear explosions, including that produced
                     by
                     starfish Prime.

                     Operation Fishbowl consisted of a total of nine high-altitude nuclear tests during 1962, with five
                     proving successful, four being aborted, and one that was cancelled before implementation. Each test
                     consisted of launching a missile that was carrying a nuclear warhead, each producing different
                     yields at different altitudes.

                     Bluegill was the first test conducted under Operation Fishbowl on June 2, 1962. The nuclear warhead
                     was carried by a Thor missile which successfully launched, but due to radar tracking equipment
                     losing the missile mid-flight, the warhead was destroyed and the test was aborted.

                     to be destroyed before it had even launched, but this caused damage to the launch pad and caked the
                     area in radioactive core materials, leading to a halt on operations while the site underwent
                     decontamination.

                  <p>
                     On October 19, Checkmate was launched with a nuclear warhead being carried by an
                     XM-33 Strypi rocket. The nuclear warhead successfully detonated at an altitude of 147 kilometres,
                     and while the yield of the nuclear explosion remained classified, it was reported to have been
                     between 10 to 20 kilotons.

                     Kingfish launched on November 1, which once again saw a Thor rocket carrying the nuclear warhead.
                     The rocket reached an altitude of around 96 kilometres before the warhead successfully detonated,
                     producing a yield of between 200 - 400 kilotons.

                     Tightrope was the final atmospheric test of Operation Fishbowl and took place on November 3. The
                     operation launched a Nike-Hercules missile to an altitude of 21 kilometres and successfully
                     detonate the warhead, producing a yield of between 10 to 20 kilotons. This was the lowest altitude
                     test of the entire operation.

                  <p>
                     A popular theory among those that subscribe to the flat-earth concept is that the real purpose of
                     Operation Fishbowl was to test or create a hole in a firmament that domes the supposed disc-shaped
                     earth, protecting us from external waters.
                     <br /><br />
                     The original concept that a firmament surrounds the earth stems as far back as ancient Babylonian
                     mythology, on into Egyptian texts and through to verses in the Bible:
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <blockquote class="quote mx-6 text-justify">
                     "And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters
                     which were above the firmament: and it was so."

                  <p>
                     Flat Earthers point to the naming of the operation, "Fishbowl", as an insinuation that Earth is
                     surrounded by a firmament, and that the high-altitude missiles that were launched likely detonated
                     on impact with the dome, rather than being remotely detonated, therefore being unsuccessful in
                     penetrating the firmament.

                     A lesser considered theory is that the high-altitude warhead tests were a response to the increased
                     sightings of UFOs around the early 1960s, though a 2024 Department of Defense report revealed that
                     the likely explanation for such sightings was due to U.S. spy plane and space technology tests:
